			<blockquote epub:type="z3998:letter">
				<p>This is Wednesday; the day that I was to have lost my charmer forever to the hideous Solmes! With what high satisfaction and heart’s-ease can I now sit down, and triumph over my men in straw at Harlowe-place! Yet ’tis perhaps best for them, that she got off as she did. Who knows what consequences might have followed upon my attending her in; or (if she had not met me) upon my projected visit, followed by my myrmidons?</p>
				<p>But had I even gone in with her unaccompanied, I think I had but little reason for apprehension: for well thou knowest, that <em>the tame spirits</em> which value themselves upon reputation, and are held within the skirts of the law by political considerations only, may be compared to an infectious spider; which will run into his hole the moment one of his threads is touched by a finger that can crush him, leaving all his toils defenceless, and to be brushed down at the will of the potent invader. While a silly fly, that has neither courage nor strength to resist, no sooner gives notice, by its buzz and its struggles, of its being entangled, but out steps the self-circumscribed tyrant, winds round and round the poor insect, till he covers it with his bowel-spun toils; and when so fully secured, that it can neither move leg nor wing, suspends it, as if for a spectacle to be exulted over: then stalking to the door of his cell, turns about, gloats over it at a distance; and, sometimes advancing, sometimes retiring, preys at leisure upon its vitals.</p>
				<p>But now I think of it, will not this comparison do as well for the <em>entangled girls</em>, as for the <em>tame spirits</em>?⁠—Better o’ my conscience!⁠—’Tis but comparing the spider to us brave fellows, and it <em>quadrates</em>.</p>
				<p>Whatever our hearts are in, our heads will follow. Begin with <em>spiders</em>, with <em>flies</em>, with what we will, girl is the centre of gravity, and we all naturally tend to it.</p>
				<p>Nevertheless, to recur; I cannot but observe, that these <em>tame spirits</em> stand a poor chance in a fairly offensive war with such of us mad fellows as are above all law, and scorn to skulk behind the hypocritical screen of reputation.</p>
				<p>Thou knowest that I never scruple to throw myself amongst numbers of adversaries; the more the safer: one or two, no fear, will take the part of a single adventurer, if not <em>intentionally</em>, in <em>fact</em>; holding him in, while others hold in the principal antagonist, to the augmentation of their mutual prowess, till both are prevailed upon to compromise, or one to be absent: so that, upon the whole, the lawbreakers have the advantage of the law-keepers, all the world over; at least for a time, and till they have run to the end of their race. Add to this, in the question between me and the Harlowes, that the whole family of them must know that they have injured me⁠—must therefore be afraid of me. Did they not, at their own church, cluster together like bees, when they saw me enter it? Nor knew they which should venture out first, when the service was over.</p>
				<p>James, indeed, was not there. If he had, he would perhaps have endeavoured to <em>look</em> valiant. But there is a sort of valour in the <em>face</em>, which shows fear in the <em>heart</em>: just such a face would James Harlowe’s have been, had I made them a visit.</p>
				<p>When I have had such a face and such a heart as I have described to deal with, I have been all calm and serene, and left it to the friends of the blusterer (as I have done to the Harlowes) to do my work for me.</p>
				<p>I am about mustering up in my memory, all that I have ever done, that has been thought praiseworthy, or but barely tolerable. I am afraid thou canst not help me to many remembrances of this sort; because I never was so bad as since I have known thee.</p>
				<p>Have I not had it in my heart to do <em>some</em> good that thou canst not remind me of? Study for me, Jack. I have recollected some instances which I think will <em>tell in</em>⁠—but see if thou canst not help me to some which I may have forgot.</p>
				<p>This I may venture to say, that the principal blot in my escutcheon is owing to these girls, these confounded girls. But for <em>them</em>, I could go to church with a good conscience: but when I do, there they are. Everywhere does Satan spread his snares for me! But, how I think of it, what if our governor should appoint churches for the <em>women</em> only, and others for the <em>men</em>?⁠—Full as proper, I think, for the promoting of <em>true piety</em> in both, (much better than the synagogue-lattices), as separate boarding-schools for their <em>education</em>.</p>
				<p>There are already male and female dedications of churches.</p>
				<p><abbr>St.</abbr> Swithin’s, <abbr>St.</abbr> Stephen’s, <abbr>St.</abbr> Thomas’s, <abbr>St.</abbr> George’s, and so forth, might be appropriated to the men; and Santa Catharina’s, Santa Anna’s, Santa Maria’s, Santa Margaretta’s, for the women.</p>
				<p>Yet were it so, and life to be the forfeiture of being found at the female churches, I believe that I, like a second Clodius, should change my dress, to come at my Portia or Pompeia, though one the daughter of a Cato, the other the wife of a Caesar.</p>
				<p>But how I <em>excurse</em>!⁠—Yet thou usedst to say, thou likedst my excursions. If thou dost, thou’lt have enough of them: for I never had a subject I so much adored; and with which I shall probably be compelled to have so much patience before I strike the blow; if the blow I do strike.</p>
				<p>But let me call myself back to my <em>recordation</em>-subject⁠—Thou needest not remind me of my <em>Rosebud</em>. I have her in my head; and moreover have contrived to give my fair-one an hint of that affair, by the agency of honest Joseph Leman;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-72" id="noteref-72" epub:type="noteref">72</a> although I have not reaped the hoped-for credit of her acknowledgement.</p>
				<p>That’s the devil; and it was always my hard fate⁠—everything I do that is good, is but as I <em>ought</em>!⁠—Everything of a contrary nature is brought into the most glaring light against me⁠—Is this fair? Ought not a balance to be struck; and the credit carried to my account?⁠—Yet I must own too, that I half grudge Johnny this blooming maiden? for, in truth, I think a fine woman too rich a jewel to hang about a poor man’s neck.</p>
				<p>Surely, Jack, if I am guilty of a fault in my universal adorations of the sex, the <em>women</em> in general ought to love me the better for it.</p>
				<p>And so they do; I thank them heartily; except here and there a covetous little rogue comes cross me, who, under the pretence of loving virtue for its own sake, wants to have me all to herself.</p>
				<p>I have rambled enough.</p>
