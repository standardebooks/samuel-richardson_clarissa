				<p>A few words to the verbal information thou sentest me last night concerning thy poor old man; and then I rise from my seat, shake myself, refresh, new-dress, and so to my charmer, whom, notwithstanding her reserves, I hope to prevail upon to walk out with me on the Heath this warm and fine morning.</p>
				<p>The birds must have awakened her before now. They are in full song. She always gloried in accustoming herself to behold the sun rise⁠—one of God’s natural wonders, as once she called it.</p>
				<p>Her window salutes the east. The valleys must be gilded by his rays, by the time I am with her; for already have they made the uplands smile, and the face of nature cheerful.</p>
				<p>How unsuitable will thou find this gay preface to a subject so gloomy as that I am now turning to!</p>
				<p>I am glad to hear thy tedious expectations are at last answered.</p>
				<p>Thy servant tells me that thou are plaguily grieved at the old fellow’s departure.</p>
				<p>I can’t say, but thou mayest <em>look</em> as if thou wert; harassed as thou hast been for a number of days and nights with a close attendance upon a dying man, beholding his drawing-on hour⁠—pretending, for decency’s sake, to whine over his excruciating pangs; to be in the way to answer a thousand impertinent inquiries after the health of a man thou wishedest to die⁠—to pray by him⁠—for so once thou wrotest to me!⁠—To read by him⁠—to be forced to join in consultation with a crew of solemn and parading doctors, and their officious zanies, the apothecaries, joined with the butcherly tribe of scarficators; all combined to carry on the physical farce, and to cut out thongs both from his flesh and his estate⁠—to have the superadded apprehension of dividing thy interest in what he shall leave with a crew of eager-hoping, never-to-be-satisfied relations, legatees, and the devil knows who, of private gratifiers of passions laudable and illaudable⁠—in these circumstances, I wonder not that thou lookest before servants, (as little grieved as thou after <em>heirship</em>), as if thou indeed wert grieved; and as if the most wry-fac’d woe had befallen thee.</p>
				<p>Then, as I have often thought, the reflection that must naturally arise from such mortifying objects, as the death of one with whom we have been familiar, must afford, when we are obliged to attend it in its slow approaches, and in its face-twisting pangs, that it will one day be our own case, goes a great way to credit the appearance of grief.</p>
				<p>And that it is this, seriously reflected upon, may temporally give a fine air of sincerity to the wailings of lively widows, heart-exulting heirs, and residuary legatees of all denominations; since, by keeping down the inward joy, those interesting reflections must sadden the aspect, and add an appearance of real concern to the assumed sables.</p>
				<p>Well, but, now thou art come to the reward of all thy watchings, anxieties, and close attendances, tell me what it is; tell me if it compensate thy trouble, and answer thy hope?</p>
				<p>As to myself, thou seest, by the gravity of my style, how the subject has helped to mortify me. But the necessity I am under of committing either speedy matrimony, or a rape, has saddened over my gayer prospects, and, more than the case itself, contributed to make me sympathize with the present joyful-sorrow.</p>
				<p>Adieu, Jack, I must be soon out of my pain; and my Clarissa shall be soon out of hers⁠—for so does the arduousness of the case require.</p>
