				<p>You will permit me, my dear, to touch upon a few passages in your last letter, that affect me sensibly.</p>
				<p>In the first place, you must allow me to say, low as I am in spirits, that I am very angry with you, for your reflections on my relations, particularly on my father and mother, and on the memory of my grandfather. Nor, my dear, does your <em>own</em> mother always escape the keen edge of your vivacity. One cannot one’s <em>self</em> forbear to write or speak freely of those we love and honour, when grief from imagined hard treatment wrings the heart: but it goes against one to hear anybody else take the same liberties. Then you have so very strong a manner of expression where you take a distaste, that when passion has subdued, and I come (upon reflection) to see by <em>your</em> severity what I have given occasion for, I cannot help condemning myself.</p>
				<p>But least of all can I bear that you should reflect upon my mother. What, my dear, if her meekness should not be rewarded? Is the want of reward, or the want even of a grateful acknowledgement, a reason for us to dispense with what we think our duty? They were my father’s lively spirits that first made him an interest in her gentle bosom. They were the same spirits turned inward, as I have heretofore observed,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-17" id="noteref-17" epub:type="noteref">17</a> that made him so impatient when the cruel malady seized him. He always loved my mother: And would not <strong>love</strong> and <strong>pity</strong> <em>excusably</em>, nay <em>laudably</em>, make a good wife (who was an hourly witness of his pangs, when labouring under a paroxysm, and his paroxysms becoming more and more frequent, as well as more and more severe) give up her own will, her own likings, to oblige a husband, thus afflicted, whose love for <em>her</em> was unquestionable?⁠—And if so, was it not too natural (human nature is not perfect, my dear) that the husband thus humoured by the wife, should be unable to bear control from anybody else, much less contradiction from his children?</p>
				<p>If then you would avoid my highest displeasure, you must spare my mother: and, surely, you will allow me, with her, to pity, as well as to love and honour my father.</p>
				<p>I have no friend but you to whom I can appeal, to whom I dare complain. Unhappily circumstanced as I am, it is but too probable that I <em>shall</em> complain, because it is but too probably that I shall have more and more cause given me <em>for</em> complaint. But be it your part, if I do, to sooth my angry passions, and to soften my resentments; and this the rather, as you know what an influence your advice has upon me; and as you must also know, that the freedoms you take with my friends, can have no other tendency, but to weaken the sense of my duty to them, without answering any good end to myself.</p>
				<p>I cannot help owning, however, that I am pleased to have you join with me in opinion of the contempt which <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Solmes deserves from me. But yet, permit me to say, that he is not <em>quite</em> so horrible a creature as you make him: as to his <em>person</em>, I mean; for with regard to his <em>mind</em>, by all I have heard, you have done him but justice: but you have such a talent at an ugly likeness, and such a vivacity, that they sometimes carry you out of verisimilitude. In short, my dear, I have known you, in more instances than one, sit down resolved to write all that wit, rather than strict justice, could suggest upon the given occasion. Perhaps it may be thought, that I should say the less on this particular subject, because your dislike of him arises from love to me: But should it not be our aim to judge of ourselves, and of everything that affects us, as we may reasonably imagine other people would judge of us and of our actions?</p>
				<p>As to the advice you give, to resume my estate, I am determined not to litigate with my father, let what will be the consequence to myself. I may give you, at another time, a more particular answer to your reasonings on this subject: but, at present, will only observe, that it is in my opinion, that Lovelace himself would hardly think me worth addressing, were he to know <em>this</em> would be my resolution. These <em>men</em>, my dear, with all their flatteries, look forward to the <strong>permanent</strong>. Indeed, it is fit they should. For love must be a very foolish thing to look back upon, when it has brought persons born to affluence into indigence, and laid a generous mind under obligation and dependence.</p>
				<p>You very ingeniously account for the love we bear to one another, from the <em>difference</em> in our tempers. I own, I should not have thought of that. There may possibly be something in it: but whether there be or not, whenever I am cool, and give myself time to reflect, I will love you the better for the correction you give, be as severe as you will upon me. Spare me not, therefore, my dear friend, whenever you think me in the least faulty. I love your agreeable raillery: you know I always did: nor, however <em>over</em>-serious you think me, did I ever think you <em>flippant</em>, as you harshly call it. One of the first conditions of our mutual friendship was, each should say or write to the other whatever was upon her mind, without any offence to be taken: a condition, that is indeed indispensable in friendship.</p>
				<p>I knew your mother would be for implicit obedience in a child. I am sorry my case is so circumstanced, that I <em>cannot</em> comply. It would be my duty to do so, if I could. You are indeed very happy, that you have nothing but your own agreeable, yet whimsical, humours to contend with, in the choice she invites you to make of <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Hickman. How happy I should be, to be treated with so much lenity!⁠—I should blush to have my mother say, that she <em>begged</em> and <em>prayed</em> me, and all in vain, to encourage a man so unexceptionable as <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Hickman.</p>
				<p>Indeed, my beloved Miss Howe, I am ashamed to have your mother say, with <strong>me</strong> in her view, “What strange effects have prepossession and love upon young creatures of our sex!” This touches me the more sensibly, because you yourself, my dear, are so ready to <em>persuade</em> me into it.</p>
				<p>I should be very blamable to endeavour to hide any the least bias upon my mind, from you: and I cannot but say⁠—that this man⁠—this Lovelace⁠—is a man that might be liked well enough, if he bore such a character as <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Hickman bears; and even if there were hopes of reclaiming him. And further still I will acknowledge, that I believe it possible that one might be driven, by violent measures, step by step, as it were, into something that might be called⁠—I don’t know what to call it⁠—a <q>conditional kind of liking</q>, or so. But as to the word <strong>love</strong>⁠—justifiable and charming as it is in some cases, (that is to say, in all the <em>relative</em>, in all the <em>social</em>, and, what is still beyond <em>both</em>, in all our <em>superior</em> duties, in which it may be properly called <em>divine</em>); it has, methinks, in the narrow, circumscribed, selfish, peculiar sense, in which you apply it to me, (the man too so little to be approved of for his morals, if all that report says of him be true), no pretty sound with it. Treat me as freely as you will in all other respects, I will love you, as I have said, the better for your friendly freedom. But, methinks, I could be glad that you would not let this imputation pass so glibly from <em>your</em> pen, or <em>your</em> lips, as attributable to one of your <em>own</em> sex, whether I be the person or not: since the <em>other</em> must have a <em>double</em> triumph, when a person of your delicacy (armed with such contempts of them all, as you would have one think) can give up a friend, with an exultation over her weakness, as a silly, lovesick creature.</p>
				<p>I could make some other observations upon the contents of your last two letters; but my mind is not free enough at present. The occasion for the above stuck with me; and I could not help taking the earliest notice of them.</p>
				<p>Having written to the end of my second sheet, I will close this letter, and in my next, acquaint you with all that has happened here since my last.</p>
