				<p>Yours reached me this moment, by an extraordinary push in the messengers.</p>
				<p>What a man of honour thou of a sudden!⁠—</p>
				<p>And so, in the imaginary shape of a guarantee, thou threatenest me!</p>
				<p>Had I <em>not</em> been in earnest as to the lady, I should not have offered to employ thee in the affair. But, let me say, that <em>hadst</em> thou undertaken the task, and I hadst afterwards thought fit to change my mind, I should have contented myself to tell thee, that that <em>was</em> my mind when thou engagedst for me, and to have given thee the reasons for the change, and then left thee to thy own discretion: for never knew I what fear of man was⁠—nor fear of woman neither, till I became acquainted with Miss Clarissa Harlowe, nay, what is <em>most</em> surprising, till I came to have her in my power.</p>
				<p>And so thou wilt not wait upon the charmer of my heart, but upon terms and conditions!⁠—Let it alone and be curs’d; I care not.⁠—But so much credit did I give to the value thou expressedst for <em>her</em>, that I thought the office would have been acceptable to <em>thee</em>, as serviceable to me; for what was it, but to endeavour to persuade her to consent to the reparation of her own honour? For what have I done but disgraced myself, and been a thief to my own joys?⁠—And if there be a union of hearts, and an intention to solemnize, what is there wanting but the foolish ceremony?⁠—and that I still offer. But, if she will keep back her hand, if she will make me hold out mine in vain, how can I help it?</p>
				<p>I write her one more letter; and if, after she has received that, she keeps sullen silence, she must thank herself for what is to follow.</p>
				<p>But, after all, my heart is not wholly hers. I love her beyond expression; and cannot help it. I hope therefore she will receive this last tender as I wish. I hope she intends not, like a true woman, to plague, and vex, and tease me, now she has found her power. If she will take me to mercy now these remorses are upon me, (though I scorn to condition with <em>thee</em> for my sincerity), all her trials, as I have heretofore declared, shall be over, and she shall be as happy as I can make her: for, ruminating upon all that has passed between us, from the first hour of our acquaintance till the present, I must pronounce, That she is virtue itself and once more I say, has no equal.</p>
				<p>As to what you hint, of leaving to her choice another day, do you consider, that it will be impossible that my contrivances and stratagems should be much longer concealed?⁠—This makes me press <em>that</em> day, though so near; and the more, as I have made so much ado about her uncle’s anniversary. If she send me the <em>four words</em>, I will spare no fatigue to be in time, if not for the canonical hour at church, for some other hour of the day in her own apartment, or any other: for money will do everything: and <em>that</em> I have never spared in this affair.</p>
				<p>To show thee, that I am not at enmity with thee, I enclose the copies of two letters⁠—one to her: it is the <em>fourth</em>, and must be the <em>last</em> on the subject⁠—The other to Captain Tomlinson; calculated, as thou wilt see, for him to show her.</p>
				<p>And now, Jack, interfere; in this case or not, thou knowest the mind of</p>
