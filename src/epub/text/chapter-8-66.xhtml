						<p epub:type="z3998:salutation">Worthy Sir,</p>
					</header>
					<p>I am under no <em>small concern</em>, that I should (unhappily) be the <em>occasion</em> (I am sure I <em>intended</em> nothing like it) of <em>widening differences</em> by <em>light misreport</em>, when it is the <em>duty</em> of one of <em>my function</em> (and no less consisting with my <em>inclination</em>) to <em>heal</em> and <em>reconcile</em>.</p>
					<p>I have received two letters to set me <em>right</em>: one from a <em>particular acquaintance</em>, (whom I set to inquire of <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Belford’s character); and that came on Tuesday last, informing me, that your <em>unhappy niece</em> was greatly injured in the account I had had of her; (for I had told <em>him</em> of it, and that with very <em>great concern</em>, I am sure, apprehending it to be <em>true</em>.) So I <em>then</em> set about writing to you, to <em>acknowledge</em> the <em>error</em>. And had gone a good way in it, when the second letter came (a very <em>handsome one</em> it is, both in <em>style</em> and <em>penmanship</em>) from my friend <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Walton, (though I am sure it cannot be <em>his inditing</em>,) expressing his sorrow, and his wife’s, and his sister-in-law’s likewise, for having been the cause of <em>misleading me</em>, in the account I gave of the said <em>young lady</em>; whom they <em>now</em> say (upon <em>further inquiry</em>) they find to be the <em>most unblameable</em>, and <em>most prudent</em>, and (it seems) the most <em>pious</em> young lady, that ever (once) committed a <em>great error</em>; as (to be sure) <em>hers</em> was, in leaving such <em>worthy parents</em> and <em>relations</em> for so <em>vile a man</em> as <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Lovelace; but what shall we say?⁠—Why, the divine Virgil tells us,</p>
					<blockquote epub:type="z3998:verse">

								<i xml:lang="la">Improbe amor, quid non mortalia pectora cogis?</i>
							</span>
						</p>
					</blockquote>
					<p>For <em>my part</em>, I was but too much afraid (for we have <em>great opportunities)</em>, you are sensible, Sir, at the <em>University</em>, of knowing <em>human nature</em> from <em>books</em>, the <em>calm result</em> of the <em>wise man’s</em> wisdom, as I may say,</p>
					<blockquote epub:type="z3998:verse">

					</blockquote>
					<p class="continued"><em>uninterrupted</em> by the <em>noise</em> and <em>vanities</em> that will mingle with <em>personal conversation</em>, which (in the <em>turbulent world</em>) is not to be enjoyed but over a <em>bottle</em>, where you have an <em>hundred foolish things</em> pass to <em>one that deserveth to be remembered</em>; I was but too much afraid <em>I say</em>, that so <em>great a slip</em> might be attended with <em>still greater</em> and <em>worse</em>: for <em>your</em> Horace, and <em>my</em> Horace, the most charming writer that ever lived among the <em>Pagans</em> (for the <em>lyric kind of poetry</em>, I mean; for, the be sure, <em>Homer</em> and <em>Virgil</em> would <em>otherwise</em> be <em>first</em> named <em>in their way</em>) well observeth (and who understood <em>human nature</em> better than he?)</p>

					<p>And <em>Ovid</em> no less wisely observeth:</p>

					<p>Who, that can draw <em>knowledge</em> from its <em>fountainhead</em>, the works of the <em>sages of antiquity</em>, (improved by the <em>comments</em> of the <em>moderns</em>,) but would <em>prefer</em> to all others the <em>silent quiet life</em>, which <em>contemplative men</em> lead in the <em>seats of learning</em>, were they not called out (according to their <em>dedication</em>) to the <em>service</em> and <em>instruction</em> of the world?</p>
					<p>Now, Sir, <em>another</em> favourite poet of mine (and not the <em>less a favourite</em> for being a <em>Christian</em>) telleth us, that ill is the custom of <em>some</em>, when in a <em>fault</em>, to throw the blame upon the backs of <em>others</em>,</p>
					<blockquote epub:type="z3998:verse">

					<p>But I, though (in this case) <em>misled</em>, (<em>well intendedly</em>, nevertheless, both in the <em>misleaders</em> and <em>misled</em>, and therefore entitled to lay hold of that plea, if <em>anybody</em> is so entitled,) will not however, be classed among such <em>extenuators</em>; but (contrarily) will always keep in mind that verse, which <em>comforteth in mistake</em>, as well as <em>instructeth</em>; and which I quoted in my last letter;</p>
					<blockquote epub:type="z3998:verse">
						<p>
							<span>
								<i xml:lang="la">Errare est hominis, sed non persistere⁠⸺</i>
							</span>
						</p>
					</blockquote>
					<p>And will own, that I was very <em>rash</em> to take up with <em>conjectures</em> and <em>consequences</em> drawn from <em>probabilites</em>, where (especially) the <em>character</em> of so <em>fine a lady</em> was concerned.</p>
					<blockquote epub:type="z3998:verse">
						<p>
							<span>
								<i xml:lang="la">“Credere fallacy gravis est dementia famae.”</i>
							</span>
						</p>
						<cite>Mant.</cite>
					</blockquote>
					<p>Notwithstanding, Miss Clarissa Harlowe (I must be bold to say) is the <em>only young lady</em>, that ever I heard of (or indeed read of) that, <em>having made such a false step</em>, so <em>soon</em> (of <em>her own accord</em>, as I may say) <em>recovered</em> herself, and conquered her <em>love of the deceiver</em>; (a great conquest indeed!) and who flieth him, and resolveth to <em>die</em>, rather than to be his; which now, to her never-dying <em>honour</em> (I am well assured) is the case⁠—and, in <em>justice</em> to her, I am now ready to take to myself (with no small vexation) that of Ovid,</p>
					<blockquote epub:type="z3998:verse">
						<p>
							<span>
								<i xml:lang="la">Heu! patior telis vulnera facta meis.</i>
							</span>
						</p>
					</blockquote>
					<p>But yet I do insist upon it, that all <em>that part</em> of my <em>information</em>, which I took upon mine own <em>personal inquiry</em>, which is what relates to <abbr>Mr.</abbr> <em>Belford</em> and <em>his character</em>, is <em>literally true</em>; for there is not anywhere to be met with a man of a more <em>libertine character</em> as to <em>women</em>, <abbr>Mr.</abbr> <em>Lovelace</em> excepted, than he beareth.</p>
					<p>And so, Sir, I must desire of you, that you will not let <em>any blame</em> lie upon my <em>intention</em>; since you see how ready I am to <em>accuse myself</em> of too lightly giving ear to a <em>rash information</em> (not knowing it to be so, however): for I depended the more upon it, as the <em>people I had it from</em> are very <em>sober</em>, and live in the <em>fear of God</em>: and indeed when I wait upon you, you will see by their letter, that they must be <em>conscientious</em> good people: wherefore, Sir, let me be entitled, from <em>all your good family</em>, to that of my last-named poet,</p>
					<blockquote epub:type="z3998:verse">
						<p>
							<span>
								<i xml:lang="la">Aspera confesso verba remitte reo.</i>
							</span>
						</p>
					</blockquote>
					<p>And now, Sir, (what is much more becoming of my <em>function</em>,) let me, instead of appearing with the <em>face of an accuser</em>, and a <em>rash censurer</em>, (which in my <em>heart</em> I have not <em>deserved</em> to be thought,) assume the character of a <em>reconciler</em>; and propose (by way of <em>penance</em> to myself for my <em>fault</em>) to be sent up as a <em>messenger of peace</em> to the <em>pious young lady</em>; for they write me word <em>absolutely</em> (and, I believe in my heart, <em>truly</em>) that the <em>doctors</em> have <em>given her over</em>, and that she <em>cannot live</em>. Alas! alas! what a sad thing would that be, if the <em>poor bough</em>, that was only designed (as I <em>very well know</em>, and am <em>fully assured</em>) <em>to be bent, should be broken!</em></p>
					<p>Let it not, dear Sir, seem to the <em>world</em> that there was anything in your <em>resentments</em> (which, while meant for <em>reclaiming</em>, were just and fit) that hath the <em>appearance</em> of <em>violence</em>, and <em>fierce wrath</em>, and <em>inexorability</em>; (as it would look to some, if carried to extremity, after <em>repentance</em> and <em>contrition</em>, and <em>humiliation</em>, on the <em>fair offender’s</em> side:) for all this while (it seemeth) she hath been a <em>second Magdalen</em> in her <em>penitence</em>, and yet not so bad as a <em>Magdalen</em> in her <em>faults</em>; (faulty, nevertheless, as she hath been once, the Lord knoweth!</p>
					<blockquote epub:type="z3998:verse">

						</p>
					</blockquote>
					<p>Now, Sir, if I may be named for this <em>blessed</em> employment, (for, <em>Blessed is the peacemaker!</em>) I will hasten to London; and (as I know Miss had always a <em>great regard</em> to the <em>function</em> I have the honour to be of) I have no doubt of making myself acceptable to her, and to bring her, by <em>sound arguments</em>, and <em>good advice</em>, into a <em>liking of life</em>, which must be the <em>first step</em> to her <em>recovery</em>: for, when the <em>mind</em> is <em>made easy</em>, the <em>body</em> will not <em>long suffer</em>; and the <em>love of life</em> is a <em>natural passion</em>, that is soon <em>revived</em>, when fortune turneth about, and smileth:</p>

							<br/>
							<span>

							</span>
						</p>
						<cite>Ovid.</cite>
					</blockquote>
					<p>And the sweet Lucan truly observeth,</p>
					<blockquote epub:type="z3998:verse">
						<p>
							<span>
								<i xml:lang="la">⸺Fatis debentibus annos</i>
							</span>
							<br/>
							<span>
								<i xml:lang="la">Mors invita subit.⸺</i>
							</span>
						</p>
					</blockquote>
					<p>And now, Sir, let me tell you what shall be the <em>tenor</em> of my <em>pleadings</em> with her, and <em>comfortings</em> of her, as she is, as I may say, a <em>learned lady</em>; and as I can <em>explain</em> to her <em>those sentences</em>, which she cannot so readily <em>construe herself</em>: and this in order to convince <em>you</em> (did you not already <em>know</em> my <em>qualifications</em>) how well qualified I <em>am</em> for the <em>Christian office</em> to which I commend myself.</p>
					<p>I will, in the <b>First Place</b>, put her in mind of the <em>common course of things</em> in this <em>sublunary world</em>, in which <em>joy</em> and <em>sorrow, sorrow</em> and joy, succeed one another by turns; in order to convince her, that her griefs have been but according to <em>that</em> common course of things:</p>
					<blockquote epub:type="z3998:verse">
						<p>
							<span>
								<i xml:lang="la">Gaudia post luctus veniunt, post gaudia luctus.</i>
							</span>
						</p>
					</blockquote>
					<p><b>Secondly</b>, I will remind her of her own notable description of <em>sorrow</em>, whence she was once called upon to distinguish wherein <em>sorrow, grief</em>, and <em>melancholy</em>, differed from each other; which she did <em>impromptu</em>, by their <em>effects</em>, in a truly admirable manner, to the high satisfaction of everyone: I myself could not, by <em>study</em>, have distinguished <em>better</em>, nor more <em>concisely</em>⁠—<b>Sorrow</b>, said she, <em>wears</em>; <b>grief</b> <em>tears</em>; but <b>melancholy</b> <em>sooths</em>.</p>
					<p>My inference to her shall be, that since a happy reconciliation will take place, <em>grief</em> will be banished; <em>sorrow</em> dismissed; and only sweet <em>melancholy</em> remain to <em>sooth</em> and <em>indulge</em> her contrite <em>heart</em>, and show to all the world the penitent sense she hath of her great error.</p>
					<p><b>Thirdly</b>, That her <em>joys</em>,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-384" id="noteref-384" epub:type="noteref">384</a> when restored to health and favour, will be the greater, the deeper her griefs were.</p>
					<blockquote epub:type="z3998:verse">
						<p>
							<span>
								<i xml:lang="la">Gaudia, quae multo parta labore, placent.</i>
							</span>
						</p>
					</blockquote>
					<p><b>Fourthly</b>, That having <em>really</em> been guilty of a <em>great error</em>, she should not take <em>impatiently</em> the <em>correction</em> and <em>anger</em> with which she hath been treated.</p>
					<blockquote epub:type="z3998:verse">
						<p>
							<span>
								<i xml:lang="la">Leniter, ex merito quicquid patiare ferundum est.</i>
							</span>
						</p>
					</blockquote>
					<p><b>Fifthly</b>, That <em>virtue</em> must be established by <em>patience</em>; as saith Prudentius:</p>
					<blockquote epub:type="z3998:verse">
						<p>
							<span>
								<i xml:lang="la">Haec virtus vidua est, quam non patientia firmat.</i>
							</span>
						</p>
					</blockquote>
					<p><b>Sixthly</b>, That in the words of Horace, she may <em>expect better times</em>, than (of late) she had <em>reason</em> to look for.</p>
					<blockquote epub:type="z3998:verse">
						<p>
							<span>
								<i xml:lang="la">Grata superveniet, quae non sperabitur, hora.</i>
							</span>
						</p>
					</blockquote>
					<p><b>Seventhly</b>, That she is really now in <em>a way</em> to be <em>happy</em>, since, according to <em>Ovid</em>, she <em>can count up all her woe</em>:</p>
					<blockquote epub:type="z3998:verse">
						<p>
							<span>
								<i xml:lang="la">Felix, qui patitur quae numerare potest.</i>
							</span>
						</p>
					</blockquote>
					<p>And those comforting lines,</p>
					<blockquote epub:type="z3998:verse">
						<p>
							<span>
								<i xml:lang="la">Estque serena dies post longos gratior imbres,</i>
							</span>
							<br/>
							<span>
								<i xml:lang="la">Et post triste malum gratior ipsa salus.</i>
							</span>
						</p>
					</blockquote>
					<p><b>Eighthly</b>, That, in the words of Mantuan, her <em>parents</em> and <em>uncles</em> could not <em>help loving her</em> all the time they were <em>angry at her</em>:</p>
					<blockquote epub:type="z3998:verse">
						<p>
							<span>
								<i xml:lang="la">Aequa tamen mens est, &amp; amica voluntas,</i>
							</span>
							<br/>
							<span>
								<i xml:lang="la">Sit licet in natos austere parentum.</i>
							</span>
						</p>
					</blockquote>
					<p><b>Ninthly</b>, That the <em>ills she hath met with</em> may be turned (by the <em>good use</em> to be made of them) to her <em>everlasting benefit</em>; for that,</p>
					<blockquote epub:type="z3998:verse">
						<p>
							<span>
								<i xml:lang="la">Cum furit atque ferit, Deus olim parcere quaerit.</i>
							</span>
						</p>
					</blockquote>
					<p><b>Tenthly</b>, That she will be able to give a <em>fine lesson</em> (a <em>very</em> fine lesson) to all the <em>young ladies</em> of her <em>acquaintance</em>, of the <em>vanity</em> of being <em>lifted up</em> in <em>prosperity</em>, and the <em>weakness</em> of being <em>cast down</em> in <em>adversity</em>; since no one is so <em>high</em>, as to be above being <em>humbled</em>; so <em>low</em>, as to <em>need to despair</em>: for which purpose the advice of <em>Ausonius</em>,</p>
					<blockquote epub:type="z3998:verse">
						<p>
							<span>
								<i xml:lang="la">Dum fortuna juvat, caveto tolli:</i>
							</span>
							<br/>
							<span>
								<i xml:lang="la">Dum fortuna tonat, caveto mergi.</i>
							</span>
						</p>
					</blockquote>
					<p>I shall tell her, that Lucan saith well, when he calleth <em>adversity the element of patience</em>;</p>
					<blockquote epub:type="z3998:verse">
						<p>
							<span>
								<i xml:lang="la">—Gaudet patientia duris:</i>
							</span>
						</p>
					</blockquote>
					<p>That</p>
					<blockquote epub:type="z3998:verse">
						<p>
							<span>
								<i xml:lang="la">Fortunam superat virtus, prudential famam.</i>
							</span>
						</p>
					</blockquote>
					<p>That while weak souls are <em>crushed by fortune</em>, the <em>brave mind</em> maketh the fickle deity afraid of it:</p>
					<blockquote epub:type="z3998:verse">
						<p>
							<span>
								<i xml:lang="la">Fortuna fortes metuit, ignavos permit.</i>
							</span>
						</p>
					</blockquote>
					<p><b>Eleventhly</b>, That if she take the advice of <em>Horace</em>,</p>
					<blockquote epub:type="z3998:verse">
						<p>
							<span>
								<i xml:lang="la">Fortiaque adversis opponite pectora rebus,</i>
							</span>
						</p>
					</blockquote>
					<p>it will delight her <em>hereafter</em> (as <em>Virgil</em> saith) to <em>revoke her past troubles</em>:</p>
					<blockquote epub:type="z3998:verse">
						<p>
							<span>
								<i xml:lang="la">⸺Forsan &amp; haec olim meminisse juvabit.</i>
							</span>
						</p>
					</blockquote>
					<p>And, to the same purpose, <em>Juvenal</em> speaking of the <em>prating joy</em> of mariners, after all their <em>dangers are over</em>:</p>
					<blockquote epub:type="z3998:verse">
						<p>
							<span>
								<i xml:lang="la">Gaudent securi narrare pericula nautae.</i>
							</span>
						</p>
					</blockquote>
					<p>Which suiting the case so well, you’ll forgive me, Sir, for <em>popping down</em> in <em>English metre</em>, as the <em>translative impulse</em> (pardon a new word, and yet we <em>scholars</em> are not fond of <em>authenticating new</em> words) came upon me <em>uncalled for</em>:</p>
					<blockquote epub:type="z3998:verse">
						<p>
							<span>The seaman, safe on shore, with joy doth tell</span>
							<br/>
							<span>What cruel dangers him at sea befell.</span>
						</p>
					</blockquote>
					<p>With <em>these</em>, Sir, and an <em>hundred more</em> wise <em>adages</em>, which I have always at my <em>fingers’</em> end, will I (when reduced to <em>form</em> and <em>method</em>) entertain Miss; and as she is a <em>well-read</em>, and (I might say, but for this <em>one</em> great error) a <em>wise</em> young lady, I make no doubt but I shall <em>prevail</em> upon her, if not by <em>mine own arguments</em>, by those of <em>wits</em> and <em>capacities</em> that have a <em>congeniality</em> (as I may say) to <em>her own</em>, to take to heart,</p>
					<blockquote epub:type="z3998:verse">
						<p>
							<span>⸻Nor of the laws of fate complain,</span>
							<br/>
							<span>Since, though it has been cloudy, now’t clears up again.⁠⸺</span>
						</p>
					</blockquote>
					<p>Oh! what <em>wisdom</em> is there in these <em>noble classical authors!</em> A <em>wise man</em> will (upon searching into them,) always find that they speak <em>his</em> sense of <em>men</em> and <em>things</em>. Hence it is, that they so readily occur to my <em>memory</em> on every occasion⁠—though this may look like <em>vanity</em>, it is too true to be omitted; and I see not why a man may not <em>know these things of himself</em>, which <em>everybody</em> seeth and <em>saith of him</em>; who, nevertheless, perhaps know not <em>half so much as he</em>, in other matters.</p>
					<p>I know but of <em>one objection</em>, Sir, that can lie against my going; and that will arise from your kind <em>care</em> and <em>concern</em> for the <em>safety of my person</em>, in case that <em>fierce</em> and <em>terrible man</em>, the wicked <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Lovelace, (of whom everyone standeth in fear,) should come cross me, as he may be resolved to try once more to <em>gain a footing in Miss’s</em> affections: but I will trust in <em>Providence</em> for <em>my safety</em>, while I shall be engaged in a <em>cause so worthy of my function</em>; and the <em>more</em> trust in it, as he is a <em>learned man</em> as I am told.</p>
					<p>Strange too, that so <em>vile a rake</em> (I hope he will never see this!) should be a <em>learned man</em>; that is to say, that a <em>learned man</em> may be a <em>sly sinner</em>, and take opportunities, <em>as they come in his way</em>⁠—which, however, I do assure you, <em>I never did</em>,</p>
					<p>I repeat, that as he is a <em>learned man</em>, I shall <em>vest myself</em>, as I may say, in <em>classical armour</em>; beginning <em>meekly</em> with him (for, Sir, <em>bravery</em> and <em>meekness</em> are qualities <em>very consistent with each other</em>, and in no persons so shiningly <em>exert</em> themselves, as in the <em>Christian priesthood</em>; beginning <em>meekly</em> with him, I say) from Ovid,</p>
					<blockquote epub:type="z3998:verse">
						<p>
							<span>
								<i xml:lang="la">Corpora magnanimo satis est protrasse leoni:</i>
							</span>
						</p>
					</blockquote>
					<p>So that, if I should not be safe behind the <em>shield of mine own prudence</em>, I certainly should be behind the <em>shields</em> of the <em>ever-admirable classics</em>: of <em>Horace</em> particularly; who, being a <em>rake</em> (and a <em>jovial rake</em> too,) himself, must have great weight with all <em>learned rakes</em>.</p>
					<p>And who knoweth but I may be able to bring even this <em>Goliath in wickedness</em>, although in <em>person</em> but a <em>little David</em> myself, (armed with the <em>slings</em> and <em>stones</em> of the <em>ancient sages</em>,) to a due sense of his errors? And what a victory would that be!</p>
					<p>I could here, Sir, pursuing the allegory of David and Goliath, give you some of the <em>stones</em> (<em>hard arguments</em> may be called <em>stones</em>, since they <em>knock down a pertinacious opponent</em>) which I could <em>pelt him with</em>, were he to be wroth with me; and this in order to take from you, Sir, all apprehensions for my <em>life</em>, or my <em>bones</em>; but I forbear them till you demand them of me, when I have the honour to attend you in person.</p>
					<p>And now, (my dear Sir,) what remaineth, but that having shown you (what yet, I believe, you did not doubt) how <em>well qualified</em> I am to attend the lady with the <em>olive-branch</em>, I beg of you to dispatch me with it <em>out of hand</em>? For if she be so <em>very ill</em>, and if she should not live to receive the grace, which (to my knowledge) all the <em>worthy family</em> design her, how much will that grieve you all! And then, Sir, of what avail will be the <em>eulogies</em> you shall all, peradventure, join to give to her memory? For, as Martial wisely observeth,</p>
					<blockquote epub:type="z3998:verse">
						<p>
							<span>
								<i xml:lang="la">⸻Post cineres gloria sera venit.</i>
							</span>
						</p>
					</blockquote>
					<p>Then, as <em>Ausonius</em> layeth it down with <em>equal propriety</em>, that <q>those favours which are speedily conferred are the most grateful and obliging</q>⁠—</p>
					<p>And to the same purpose Ovid:</p>
					<blockquote epub:type="z3998:verse">
						<p>
							<span>
								<i xml:lang="la">Gratia ab officio, quod mora tar dat, abest.</i>
							</span>
						</p>
					</blockquote>
					<p>And, Sir, whatever you do, let the <em>lady’s</em> pardon be as <em>ample</em>, and as <em>cheerfully given</em>, as she can <em>wish for it</em>: that I may be able to tell her, that it hath your <em>hands</em>, your <em>countenances</em>, and your <em>whole hearts</em>, with it⁠—for, as the Latin verse hath it, (and I presume to think I have not weakened its sense by my humble advice),</p>
					<blockquote epub:type="z3998:verse">

							<span>
								<i xml:lang="la">Dat bene, dat multum, qui dat cum munere vultum.</i>

					<p>And now, Sir, when I survey this long letter,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-385" id="noteref-385" epub:type="noteref">385</a> (albeit I see it enamelled, as a <em>beautiful meadow</em> is enamelled by the <em>spring</em> or <em>summer</em> flowers, very glorious to behold!) I begin to be afraid that I may have tired you; and the more likely, as I have written without that <em>method</em> or <em>order</em>, which I think constituteth the <em>beauty</em> of <em>good writing</em>: which <em>method</em> or <em>order</em>, nevertheless, may be the <em>better excused</em> in a <em>familiar epistle</em>, (as this may be called,) you pardoning, Sir, the <em>familiarity</em> of the <em>word</em>; but yet not altogether <em>here</em>, I must needs own; because this is <em>a letter</em> and <em>not a letter</em>, as I may say; but a kind of <em>short</em> and <em>pithy discourse</em>, touching upon <em>various</em> and <em>sundry topics</em>, every one of which might be a <em>fit theme</em> to enlarge upon of volumes; if this <em>epistolary discourse</em> (then let me call it) should be pleasing to you, (as I am inclined to think it will, because of the <em>sentiments</em> and <em>aphorisms</em> of the <em>wisest of the antients</em>, which <em>glitter through it</em> like so many dazzling <em>sunbeams</em>,) I will (at my leisure) work it up into a <em>methodical discourse</em>; and perhaps may one day print it, with a <em>dedication</em> to my <em>honoured patron</em>, (if, Sir, I have <em>your</em> leave,) <em>singly</em> at first, (but not till I have thrown out <em>anonymously</em>, two or three <em>smaller things</em>, by the success of which I shall have made myself of <em>some account</em> in the <em>commonwealth of letters</em>,) and afterwards in my <em>works</em>⁠—not for the <em>vanity</em> of the thing (however) I will say, but for the <em>use</em> it may be of to the <em>public</em>; for, (as one well observeth,) <q>though glory always followeth virtue, yet it should be considered only as its shadow</q>.</p>

					<p>A very pretty saying, and worthy of all men’s admiration.</p>
					<p>And now, (<em>most worthy Sir</em>, my very good friend and patron,) referring the whole to <em>yours</em>,” and to your <em>two brothers</em>, and to <em>young <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Harlowe’s consideration, and to the wise consideration of good Madam Harlowe</em>, and her excellent daughter, <em>Miss Arabella Harlowe</em>; I take the liberty to subscribe myself, what I <em>truly am</em>, and <em>every shall delight to be</em>, in <em>all cases</em>, and at <em>all times</em>,</p>
