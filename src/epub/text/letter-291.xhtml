					<p epub:type="z3998:salutation">Honoured Sir,</p>
				</header>
				<p>I received yours, as your servant desired me to acquaint you, <em>by ten this morning</em>. Horse and man were in a foam.</p>
				<p>I instantly equipped myself, as if come off from a journey, and posted away to the lady, intending to plead great affairs that I came not before, in order to favour your <em>antedate</em>; and likewise to be in a <em>hurry</em>, to have a pretence to <em>hurry her ladyship</em>, and to take no denial for her giving a <em>satisfactory</em> return to your messenger. But, upon my entering <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mrs.</abbr> Sinclair’s house, I found all in the greatest consternation.</p>
				<p>You must not, Sir, be surprised. It is a trouble to me to be the relater of the bad news; but so it is⁠—The lady is gone off! She was missed but half an hour before I came.</p>
				<p>Her waiting-maid is run away, or hitherto is not to be found: so that they conclude it was by her connivance.</p>
				<p>They had sent, before I came, to my honoured masters <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Belton, <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Mowbray, and <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Belford. <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Tourville is out of town.</p>
				<p>High words are passing between Madam Sinclair, and Madam Horton, and Madam Martin; as also with Dorcas. And your servant William threatens to hang or drown himself.</p>
				<p>They have sent to know if they can hear of Mabell, the waiting-maid, at her mother’s, who it seems lives in Chick-lane, West-Smithfield; and to an uncle of hers also, who keeps an alehouse at Cow-cross, had by, and with whom she lived last.</p>
				<p>Your messenger having just changed his horse, is come back: so I will not detain him longer than to add, that I am, with great concern for this misfortune, and thanks for your seasonable favour and kind intentions towards me⁠—I am sure this was not my fault⁠—</p>
				<p>Honoured Sir,</p>
