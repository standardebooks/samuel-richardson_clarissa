				<p>Though pretty much pressed in time, and oppressed by my mother’s watchfulness, I will write a few lines upon the new light that has broken in upon your gentleman; and send it by a particular hand.</p>
				<p>I know not what to think of him upon it. He talks well; but judge him by Rowe’s lines, he is certainly a <em>dissembler</em>, odious as the sin of hypocrisy, and, as he says, that other of ingratitude, are to him.</p>
				<p>And, pray, my dear, let me ask, could he have triumphed, as it is said he has done, over so many of our sex, had he not been egregiously guilty of <em>both</em> sins?</p>
				<p>His ingenuousness is the thing that staggers me: yet is he cunning enough to know, that whoever accuses him first, blunts the edge of an adversary’s accusation.</p>
				<p>He is certainly a man of sense: there is more hope of such a one than a fool: and there must be a <em>beginning</em> to a reformation. These I will allow in his favour.</p>
				<p>But this, that follows, I think, is the only way to judge of his specious confessions and self-accusations⁠—Does he confess anything that you knew not before, or that you are not likely to find out from others?⁠—If nothing else, what does he confess to his own disadvantage? You have heard of his duels: you have heard of his seductions.⁠—All the world has. He <em>owns</em>, therefore, what it would be to no purpose to <em>conceal</em>; and his ingenuousness is a salvo⁠—“Why, this, Madam, is no more than <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Lovelace <em>himself</em> acknowledges.”</p>
				<p>Well, but what is now to be done?⁠—You must make the best of your situation: and as you say, so he has proposed to you of Windsor, and his canon’s house. His readiness to leave you, and go himself in quest of a lodging, likewise looks well. And I think there is nothing can be so properly done, as (whether you get to a canon’s house or not) that the canon should join you together in wedlock as soon as possible.</p>
				<p>I much approve, however, of all your cautions, of all your vigilance, and of everything you have done, but of your <em>meeting him</em>. Yet, in my disapprobation of that, I judge by that event only: for who would have divined it would have been concluded as it did? But he is the devil by his own account: and had he run away with the wretched Solmes, and your more wretched brother, and himself been transported for life, he should have had my free consent for all three.</p>
				<p>What use does he make of that Joseph Leman!⁠—His ingenuousness, I must more than once say, confounds me; but if, my dear, you can forgive your brother for the part he put that fellow upon acting, I don’t know whether you ought to be angry at Lovelace. Yet I have wished fifty times, since Lovelace got you away, that you were rid of him, whether it were by a burning fever, by hanging, by drowning, or by a broken neck; provided it were before he laid you under a necessity to go into mourning for him.</p>
				<p>I repeat my hitherto rejected offer. May I send it safely by your old man? I have reasons for not sending it by Hickman’s servant; unless I had a bank note. Inquiring for such may cause distrust. My mother is so busy, so inquisitive⁠—I don’t love suspicious tempers.</p>
				<p>And here she is continually in and out⁠—I must break off.</p>
				<hr/>
				<p><abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Hickman begs his most respectful compliments to you, with offer of his services. I told him I would oblige him, because minds in trouble take kindly anybody’s civilities: but that he was not to imagine that he particularly obliged me by this; since I should think the man or woman either blind or stupid who admired not a person of your exalted merit for your own sake, and wished not to serve you without view to other reward than the honour of serving you.</p>
				<p><q>To be sure, that was his principal motive</q>, with great daintiness he said it: but with a kiss of his hand, and a bow to my feet, he hoped, that a fine lady’s being <em>my friend</em> did not lessen the merit of the reverence he really had for her.</p>
				<p>Believe me ever, what you, my dear, shall ever find me,</p>
