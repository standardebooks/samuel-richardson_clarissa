				<p>I will send you a large packet, as you desire and expect; since I can do it by so safe a conveyance: but not all that is come to my hand⁠—for I must own that my friends are very severe; too severe for anybody, who loves them not, to see their letters. You, my dear, would not call them my <em>friends</em>, you said, long ago; but my <em>relations</em>: indeed I cannot call them my <em>relations</em>, I think!⁠—But I am ill; and therefore perhaps more peevish than I should be. It is difficult to go out of ourselves to give a judgment against ourselves; and yet, oftentimes, to pass a <em>just</em> judgment, we ought.</p>
				<p>I thought I should alarm you in the choice of my executor. But the sad necessity I am reduced to must excuse me.</p>
				<p>I shall not repeat anything I have said before on that subject: but if your objections will not be answered to your satisfaction by the papers and letters I shall enclose, marked 1, 2, 3, 4, to 9, I must think myself in another instance unhappy; since I am engaged too far (and with my own judgment too) to recede.</p>
				<p>As <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Belford has transcribed for me, in confidence, from his friend’s letters, the passages which accompany this, I must insist that you suffer no soul but yourself to peruse them; and that you return them by the very first opportunity; that so no use may be made of them that may do hurt either to the original writer or to the communicator. You’ll observe I am bound by promise to this care. If through my means any mischief should arise, between this <em>humane</em> and that <em>inhuman</em> libertine, I should think myself utterly inexcusable.</p>
				<p>I subjoin a list of the papers or letters I shall enclose. You must return them all when perused.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-326" id="noteref-326" epub:type="noteref">326</a></p>
				<p>You will see by these several Letters, written and received in so little a space of time (to say nothing of what I have received and written which I cannot show you), how little opportunity or leisure I can have for writing my own story.</p>
				<p>I am very much tired and fatigued⁠—with⁠—I don’t know what⁠—with writing, I think⁠—but most with myself, and with a situation I cannot help aspiring to get out of, and above!</p>
				<p>O my dear, the world we live in is a sad, a very sad world!⁠—While under our parents’ protecting wings, we know nothing at all of it. Book-learned and a scribbler, and looking at people as I saw them as visitors or visiting, I thought I knew a great deal of it. Pitiable ignorance!⁠—Alas! I knew nothing at all!</p>
				<p>With zealous wishes for your happiness, and the happiness of everyone dear to you, I am, and will ever be,</p>
