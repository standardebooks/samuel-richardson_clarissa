				<p>I have a most provoking letter from my sister. I might have supposed she would resent the contempt she brought upon herself in my chamber. Her conduct surely can only be accounted for by the rage instigate by a supposed rivalry.</p>

					</header>
					<p>I am to tell you, that your mother has begged you off for the morrow: but that you have effectually done your business with her, as well as with everybody else.</p>
					<p>In your proposals and letter to your brother, you have shown yourself so silly, and so wise; so young, and so old; so gentle, and so obstinate; so meek, and so violent; that never was there so mixed a character.</p>
					<p>We all know <em>of whom</em> you have borrowed this new spirit. And yet the seeds of it must be in your heart, or it could not all at once show itself so rampant. It would be doing <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Solmes a spite to wish him such a <em>shy, un-shy</em> girl; another of your contradictory qualities⁠—I leave you to make out what I mean by it.</p>
					<p><em>Here</em>, Miss, your mother will not let you remain: she cannot have any peace of mind while such a rebel of a child is so near her. Your aunt Hervey will not take a charge which all the family put together cannot manage. Your uncle Harlowe will not see you at his house, till you are married. So, thanks to your own stubbornness, you have nobody that will receive you but your uncle Antony. Thither you must go in a very few days; and, when there, your brother will settle with you, in my presence, all that relates to your modest challenge; for it is accepted, I assure you. <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Dr.</abbr> Lewen will possibly be there, since you make choice of him. <em>Another</em> gentleman likewise, were it but to convince you, that he is another sort of man than you have taken him to be. Your two uncles will <em>possibly</em> be there too, to see that the <em>poor</em>, <em>weak</em>, and <em>defenceless</em> sister has fair play. So, you see, Miss, what company your smart challenge will draw together.</p>
					<p>Prepare for the day. You’ll soon be called upon. Adieu, Mamma Norton’s sweet child!</p>

				<p>This answer I received in an open slip of paper; but it was wet in one place. I kissed the place; for I am sure it was blistered, as I may say, by a mother’s tear!⁠—She must (I <em>hope</em> she must) have written it reluctantly.</p>

					<p>To apply for protection, where authority is defied, is bold. Your sister, who would not in <em>your</em> circumstances have been guilty of <em>your</em> perverseness, may allowably be angry at you for it.

				<p>Give me, my dearest Miss Howe, your opinion, what I <em>can</em>, what I <em>ought</em> to do. Not what you would do (pushed as I am pushed) in <em>resentment</em> or <em>passion</em>⁠—since, so instigated, you tell me, that you should have been with somebody before now⁠—and steps taken in passion hardly ever fail of giving cause for repentance: but acquaint me with what you think cool judgment, and after-reflection, whatever were to be the event, will justify.</p>
				<p>I doubt not your <em>sympathizing</em> love: but yet you cannot possibly feel indignity and persecution so very sensibly as the immediate sufferer feels them⁠—are <em>fitter</em> therefore to advise me, than I am myself.</p>
				<p>I will here rest my cause. Have I, or have I not, suffered or borne enough? And if they will still persevere; if that strange persister against an antipathy so strongly avowed, will <em>still</em> persist; say, What <em>can</em> I do?⁠—What course pursue?⁠—Shall I fly to London, and endeavour to hide myself from Lovelace, as well as from all my own relations, till my cousin Morden arrives? Or shall I embark for Leghorn in my way to my cousin? Yet, my sex, my youth, considered, how full of danger is this last measure!⁠—And may not my cousin be set out for England, while I am getting thither?⁠—What <em>can</em> I do?⁠—Tell me, tell me, my dearest Miss Howe, (for I dare not trust myself), tell me, what I <em>can</em> do.</p>

				<p epub:type="se:letter.dateline">Eleven o’clock at night.</p>
				<p>I have been forced to try to compose my angry passions at my harpsichord; having first shut close my doors and windows, that I might not be heard below. As I was closing the shutters of the windows, the distant whooting of the bird of Minerva, as from the often-visited woodhouse, gave the subject in that charming <i epub:type="se:name.publication.poem">Ode to Wisdom</i>, which does honour to our sex, as it was written by one of it. I made an essay, a week ago, to set the three last stanzas of it, as not unsuitable to my unhappy situation; and after I had re-perused the <i epub:type="se:name.publication.poem">Ode</i>, those were my lesson; and, I am sure, in the solemn address they contain to the All-Wise and All-powerful Deity, my heart went with my fingers.</p>
				<p>I enclose the Ode, and my effort with it. The subject is solemn; my circumstances are affecting; and I flatter myself, that I have not been quite unhappy in the performance. If it obtain your approbation, I shall be out of doubt, and should be still more assured, could I hear it tried by <em>your</em> voice and finger.</p>
