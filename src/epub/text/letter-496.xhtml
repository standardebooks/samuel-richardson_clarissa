					<p epub:type="z3998:salutation">Dear Jack,</p>
				</header>
				<p>I send you enclosed a letter from <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Lovelace; which, though written in the cursed Algebra, I know to be such a one as will show what a <em>queer</em> way he is in; for he read it to us with the air of a tragedian. You will see by it what the mad fellow had intended to do, if we had not all of us interposed. He was actually setting out with a surgeon of this place, to have the lady opened and embalmed.⁠—Rot me if it be not my full persuasion that, if he had, her heart would have been found to be either iron or marble.</p>
				<p>We have got Lord <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">M.</abbr> to him. His Lordship is also much afflicted at the lady’s death. His sisters and nieces, he says, will be ready to break their hearts. What a rout’s here about a woman! For after all she was no more.</p>
				<p>We have taken a pailful of black bull’s blood from him; and this has lowered him a little. But he threatens <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Col.</abbr> Morden, he threatens you for your cursed reflections, (cursed reflections indeed, Jack!) and curses all the world and himself still.</p>
				<p>Last night his mourning (which is full as deep as for a wife) was brought home, and his fellows’ mourning too. And, though eight o’clock, he would put it on, and make them attend him in theirs.</p>
				<p>Everybody blames him on this lady’s account. But I see not for why. She was a <em>vixen</em> in her virtue. What a pretty fellow she has ruined⁠—Hey, Jack!⁠—and her relations are ten times more to blame than he. I will prove this to the teeth of them all. If <em>they</em> could use her ill, why should they expect <em>him</em> to use her well?⁠—You, or I, or Tourville, in his shoes, would have done as he has done. <em>Are not all the girls forewarned?</em>⁠—“Has he done by her as that caitiff <em>Miles</em> did to the farmer’s daughter, whom he tricked up to town, (a pretty girl also, just such another as Bob’s Rosebud), under a notion of waiting on a lady?⁠—<em>Drilled</em> her on, pretending the lady was abroad. Drank her lighthearted⁠—then carried her to a play⁠—then it was too late, you know, to see the pretended lady⁠—then to a bagnio⁠—ruined her, as they call it, and all this the same day. Kept her on (an ugly dog, too!) a fortnight or three weeks, then left her to the mercy of the people of the bagnio, (never paying for anything), who stripped her of all her clothes, and because she would not <em>take on</em>, threw her into prison; where she died in want and despair!”⁠—A true story, thou knowest, Jack.⁠—This fellow deserved to be d⁠⸺⁠d. But has our Bob been such a villain as this?⁠—And would he not have <em>married</em> this flinty-hearted lady?⁠—<em>So he is justified very evidently.</em></p>
				<p>Why, then, should such cursed <em>qualms</em> take him?⁠—Who would have thought he had been such <em>poor blood</em>? Now (rot the puppy!) to see him sit silent in a corner, when he has tired himself with his mock majesty, and with his argumentation, (Who so fond of <em>arguing</em> as he?) and teaching his shadow to make mouths against the wainscot⁠—The devil fetch me if I have patience with him!</p>
				<p>But he has had no rest for these ten days⁠—that’s the thing!⁠—You must write to him; and pr’ythee coax him, Jack, and send him what he writes for, and give him all his way⁠—there will be no bearing him else. And get the lady buried as fast as you can; and don’t let him know where.</p>
				<p>This letter should have gone yesterday. We told him it did. But were in hopes he would have inquired after it again. But he raves <em>as he has not</em> any answer.</p>
				<p>What he <em>vouchsafed</em> to read of other of your letters has given my Lord such a curiosity as makes him desire you to continue your accounts. Pray do; but not in your hellish <em>Arabic</em>; and we will let the poor fellow only into what we think fitting for his present way.</p>
				<p>I live a cursed dull poking life here. What with I so lately saw of poor Belton, and what I now see of this charming fellow, I shall be as crazy as he soon, or as dull as thou, Jack; so must seek for better company in town than either of you. I have been forced to read sometimes to divert me; and you know I hate reading. It presently sets me into a fit of drowsiness; and then I yawn and stretch like a devil.</p>
				<p>Yet in Dryden’s <i epub:type="se:name.publication.poem">Palemon and Arcite</i> have I just now met with a passage, that has in it much of our Bob’s case. These are some of the lines.</p>
				<p class="abstract">[<abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Mowbray then recites some lines from that poem, describing a distracted man, and runs the parallel; and then, priding himself in his performance, says:]</p>
				<p>Let me tell you, that had I begun to write as early as you and Lovelace, I might have cut as good a figure as either of you. Why not? But boy or man I ever hated a book. ’Tis folly to lie. I loved <em>action</em>, my boy. I hated <em>droning</em>; and have led in former days more boys from their book, than ever my master made to profit by it. Kicking and cuffing, and orchard-robbing, were my early glory.</p>
				<p>But I am tired of writing. I never wrote such a long letter in my life. My wrist and my fingers and thumb ache d⁠⸺⁠n⁠—y. The pen is an hundred weight at least. And my eyes are ready to drop out of my head upon the paper.⁠—The cramp but this minute in my fingers. Rot the goose and the goose-quill! I will write no more long letters for a twelvemonth to come. Yet one word; we think the mad fellow coming to. Adieu.</p>
