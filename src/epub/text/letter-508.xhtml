				</header>
				<p>I have been employed in a most melancholy task: in reading the will of the dear deceased.</p>
				<p>The unhappy mother and <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mrs.</abbr> Norton chose to be absent on the affecting occasion. But <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mrs.</abbr> Harlowe made it her earnest request that every article of it should be fulfilled.</p>
				<p>They were all extremely touched with the preamble.</p>
				<p>The first words of the will⁠—“I, Clarissa Harlowe, now by strange melancholy accidents, lodging,” <abbr>etc.</abbr> drew tears from some, sighs from all.</p>
				<p>The directions for her funeral, in case she were or were not permitted to be carried down; the mention of her orders having been given for the manner of her being laid out, and the presence of mind so visible throughout the whole, obtained their admiration, expressed by hands and eyes lifted up, and by falling tears.</p>
				<p>When I read the direction, “That her body was not to be viewed, except any of her relations should <em>vouchsafe</em>, <em>for the last time</em>, <em>to look upon her</em>;” they turned away, and turned to me, three or four times alternately. <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mrs.</abbr> Hervey and Miss Arabella sobbed; the uncles wiped their eyes; the brother looked down; the father wrung his hands.</p>
				<p>I was obliged to stop at the words, “That she was <em>nobody’s</em>.”</p>
				<p>But when I came to the address to be made to the accursed man, “if he were not to be diverted from seeing <em>her</em> dead, whom <strong>once</strong> before he had seen in a manner dead”⁠—execration, and either vows or wishes of revenge, filled every mouth.</p>
				<p>These were still more fervently renewed, when they came to hear read her forgiveness of even this man.</p>
				<p>You remember, Sir, on our first reading of the will in town, the observations I made on the foul play which it is evident the excellent creature met with from this abandoned man, and what I said upon the occasion. I am not used to repeat things of that nature.</p>
				<p>The dear creature’s noble contempt of the <em>nothing</em>, as she nobly calls it, about which she had been giving such particular directions, to wit, her body; and her apologizing for the particularity of those directions from the circumstances she was in⁠—had the same, and as strong an effect upon me, as when I first read the animated paragraph; and, pointed by my eye, (by turns cast upon them all), affected them all.</p>
				<p>When the article was read which bequeathed to the father the grandfather’s estate, and the reason assigned for it, (so generous and so dutiful), the father could sit no longer; but withdrew, wiping his eyes, and lifting up his spread hands at <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> James Harlowe; who rose to attend him to the door, as Arabella likewise did⁠—All he could say⁠—O Son! Son!⁠—O Girl! Girl!⁠—as if he reproached them for the parts they had acted, and put him upon acting.</p>
				<p>But yet, on some occasions, this brother and sister showed themselves to be true will disputants.</p>
				<p>Let tongue and eyes express what they will, <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Belford, the first reading of a will, where a person dies worth anything considerable, generally affords a true test of the relations’ love to the deceased.</p>
				<p>The clothes, the thirty guineas for mourning to <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mrs.</abbr> Norton, with the recommendation of the good woman for housekeeper at The Grove, were thought sufficient, had the article of £600 which was called monstrous, been omitted. Some other passages in the will were called <q>flights</q>, <q>and such whimsies as distinguish people of imagination from those of judgment</q>.</p>
				<p>My cousin Dolly Hervey was grudged the library. Miss Harlowe said, That as she and her sister never bought the same books, she would take that to herself, and would <em>make it up</em> to her cousin Dolly <em>one way or other</em>.</p>
				<p>I intend, <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Belford, to save you the trouble of interposing⁠—the library <em>shall</em> be my cousin Dolly’s.</p>
				<p><abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mrs.</abbr> Hervey could hardly keep her seat. On <em>this</em> occasion, however, she only said, That her late dear and <em>ever</em> dear niece, was <em>too good</em> to her and <em>hers</em>. But, <em>at another time</em>, she declared, with tears, that she could not forgive herself for a letter she wrote,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-401" id="noteref-401" epub:type="noteref">401</a> looking at Miss Arabella, whom, it seems, unknown to anybody, she had consulted before she wrote it and which, she said, must have wounded a spirit, that now she saw had been too deeply wounded before.</p>
				<p>O my Aunt, said Arabella, no more of that!⁠—Who would have thought that the dear creature had been such a penitent?</p>
				<p><abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> John and <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Antony Harlowe were so much affected with the articles in their favour, (bequeathed to them without a word or hint of reproach or recrimination), that they broke out into self-accusations; and lamented that their sweet niece, as they called her, was not got above all grateful acknowledgement and returns. Indeed, the mutual upbraidings and grief of all present, upon those articles in which everyone was remembered for good, so often interrupted me, that the reading took up above six hours. But curses upon the accursed man were a refuge to which they often resorted to exonerate themselves.</p>
				<p>How wounding a thing, <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Belford, is a generous and well-distinguished forgiveness! What revenge can be more effectual, and more noble, were revenge intended, and were it wished to strike remorse into a guilty or ungrateful heart! But my dear cousin’s motives were all duty and love. She seems indeed to have been, as much as a mortal could be, <strong>love</strong> itself. Love sublimed by a purity, by a true delicacy, that hardly any woman before her could boast of. O <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Belford, what an example would she have given in every station of life, (as wife, mother, mistress, friend), had her lot fallen upon a man blessed with a mind like her own!</p>
				<p>The £600 bequeathed to <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mrs.</abbr> Norton, the library to Miss Hervey, and the remembrances to Miss Howe, were not the only articles grudged. Yet to what purpose did they regret the pecuniary bequests, when the poor’s fund, and not themselves, would have had the benefit, had not those legacies been bequeathed?</p>
				<p>But enough passed to convince me that my cousin was absolutely right in her choice of an executor out of the family. Had she chosen one in it, I dare say that her will would have been no more regarded than if it had been the will of a dead king; than that of Louis <span epub:type="z3998:roman">XIV</span> in particular; so flagrantly broken through by his nephew the Duke of Orleans before he was cold. The only will of that monarch, perhaps, which was ever disputed.</p>
				<p>But little does <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> James Harlowe think that, while he is grasping at hundreds, he will, most probably, lose thousands, if he be my survivor. A man of a spirit so selfish and narrow shall not be my heir.</p>
				<p>You will better conceive, <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Belford, than I can express, how much they were touched at the hint that the dear creature had been obliged to part with some of her clothes.</p>
				<p>Silent reproach seized every one of them when I came to the passage where she mentions that she deferred filling up some blanks, in hopes of receiving their last blessing and forgiveness.</p>
				<p>I will only add, that they could not bear to hear read the concluding part, so solemnly addressed to her Redeemer. They all arose from their seats, and crowded out of the apartment we were in; and then, as I afterwards found, separated, in order to seek that consolation in solitary retirement, which, though they could not hope for from their own reflections, yet, at the time, they had less reason to expect in each other’s company. I am, Sir,</p>
