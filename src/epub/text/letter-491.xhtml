			<blockquote epub:type="z3998:letter">
				<p>Now may you, my dear Arabella, unrestrained by the severity of your virtue, let fall a pitying tear on the past faults and sufferings of your late unhappy sister; since, <em>now</em>, she can never offend you more. The Divine mercy, which first inspired her with repentance (an <em>early</em> repentance it was; since it preceded her sufferings) for an error which she offers not to extenuate, although perhaps it were capable of some extenuation, has <em>now</em>, as the instant that you are reading this, as I humbly hope, blessed her with the fruits of it.</p>
				<p>Thus already, even while she writes, in imagination purified and exalted, she the more fearlessly writes to her sister; and now is assured of pardon for all those little occasions of displeasure which her forwarder youth might give you; and for the disgrace which her fall has fastened upon you, and upon her family.</p>
				<p>May you, my Sister, continue to bless those dear and honoured relations, whose indulgence so well deserves your utmost gratitude, with those cheerful instances of duty and obedience which have hitherto been so acceptable to <em>them</em>, and praiseworthy in <em>you</em>! And may you, when a suitable proposal shall offer, fill up more worthily that chasm, which the loss they have sustained in me has made in the family!</p>
				<p>Thus, my Arabella! my only sister! and for many happy years, my friend! most fervently prays that sister, whose affection for you, no acts, no unkindness, no misconstruction of her conduct, could cancel! And who <strong>now</strong>, made perfect (as she hopes) through sufferings, styles herself,</p>
