				</header>
				<p>My kinsman Lovelace is now setting out for London; proposing to see you, and then to go to Dover, and so embark. God send him well out of the kingdom!</p>
				<p>On Monday he will be with you, I believe. Pray let me be favoured with an account of all your conversations; for <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Mowbray and <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Tourville are to be there too; and whether you think he is grown quite his own man again.</p>
				<p>What I mostly write for is, to wish you to keep Colonel Morden and him asunder; and so I give you notice of his going to town. I should be very loth there should be any mischief between them, as you gave me notice that the Colonel threatened my nephew. But my kinsman would not bear that; so nobody let him know that he did. But I hope there is no fear; for the Colonel does not, as I hear, threaten now. For his own sake, I am glad of that; for there is not such a man in the world as my kinsman is said to be, at all the weapons⁠—as well he was not; he would not be so daring.</p>
				<p>We shall all here miss the wild fellow. To be sure, there is no man better company when he pleases.</p>
				<p>Pray, do you never travel thirty or forty miles? I should be glad to see you here at <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">M.</abbr> Hall. It will be charity when my kinsman is gone; for we suppose you will be his chief correspondent; although he has promised to write to my nieces often. But he is very apt to forget his promises; to us his relations particularly. God preserve us all; Amen! prays</p>
