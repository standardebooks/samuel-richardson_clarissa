				<p epub:type="se:letter.dateline">Monday Morning, <time datetime="1738-03-06">March 6</time></p>
				<p>They are resolved to break my heart. My poor Hannah is discharged—disgracefully discharged!—Thus it was.</p>
				<p>Within half an hour after I had sent the poor girl down for my breakfast, that bold creature Betty Barnes, my sister's confidant and servant, (if a favourite maid and confidant can be deemed a servant,) came up.</p>
				<p>What, Miss, will you please to have for breakfast?</p>
				<p>I was surprised. What will I have for breakfast, Betty!—How!—What!—How comes it!—Then I named Hannah. I could not tell what to say.</p>
				<p>Don't be surprised, Miss:—but you'll see Hannah no more in this house.</p>
				<p>God forbid!—Is any harm come to Hannah?—What! What is the matter with Hannah?</p>
				<p>Why, Miss, the short and the long is this: Your papa and mamma think Hannah has staid long enough in the house to do mischief; and so she is ordered to troop [that was the confident creature's word]; and I am directed to wait upon you in her stead.</p>
				<p>I burst into tears. I have no service for you, Betty Barnes; none at all. But where is Hannah? Cannot I speak with the poor girl? I owe her half a year's wages. May I not see the honest creature, and pay her her wages? I may never see her again perhaps; for they are resolved to break my heart.</p>
				<p>And they think you are resolved to break theirs: so tit for tat, Miss.</p>
				<p>Impertinent I called her; and asked her, if it were upon such confident terms that her service was to begin.</p>
				<p>I was so very earnest to see the poor maid, that (to oblige me, as she said) she went down with my request.</p>
				<p>The worthy creature was as earnest to see me; and the favour was granted in presence of Shorey and Betty.</p>
				<p>I thanked her, when she came up, for her past service to me.</p>
				<p>Her heart was ready to break. And she began to vindicate her fidelity and love; and disclaimed any mischief she had ever made.</p>
				<p>I told her, that those who occasioned her being turned out of my service, made no question of her integrity: that her dismission was intended for an indignity to me: that I was very sorry to be obliged to part with her, and hoped she would meet with as good a service.</p>
				<p>Never, never, wringing her hands, should she meet with a mistress she loved so well. And the poor creature ran on in my praises, and in professions of love to me.</p>
				<p>We are all apt, you know, my dear, to praise our benefactors, because they are our benefactors; as if every body did right or wrong, as they obliged or disobliged us. But this good creature deserved to be kindly treated; so I could have no merit in favouring one whom it would have been ungrateful not to distinguish.</p>
				<p>I gave her a little linen, some laces, and other odd things; and instead of four pounds which were due to her, ten guineas: and said, if ever I were again allowed to be my own mistress, I would think of her in the first place.</p>
				<p>Betty enviously whispered Shorey upon it.</p>
				<p>Hannah told me, before their faces, having no other opportunity, that she had been examined about letters to me, and from me: and that she had given her pockets to Miss Harlowe, who looked into them, and put her fingers in her stays, to satisfy herself that she had not any.</p>
				<p>She gave me an account of the number of my pheasants and bantams; and I said, they should be my own care twice or thrice a day.</p>
				<p>We wept over each other at parting. The girl prayed for all the family.</p>
				<p>To have so good a servant so disgracefully dismissed, is very cruel: and I could not help saying that these methods might break my heart, but not any other way answer the end of the authors of my disgraces.</p>
				<p>Betty, with a very saucy fleer, said to Shorey, There would be a trial of skill about that she fancied. But I took no notice of it. If this wench thinks that I have robbed her young mistress of a lover, as you say she has given out, she may believe that it is some degree of merit in herself to be impertinent to me.</p>
				<p>Thus have I been forced to part with my faithful Hannah. If you can command the good creature to a place worthy of her, pray do for my sake.</p>
