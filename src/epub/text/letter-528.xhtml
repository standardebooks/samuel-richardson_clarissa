				<p>It may be some satisfaction to your Lordship, to have a brief account of what has just now passed between Colonel Morden and me.</p>
				<p>We had a good deal of discourse about the Harlowe family, and those parts of the lady’s will which still remain unexecuted; after which the Colonel addressed himself to me in a manner which gave me some surprise.</p>
				<p>He flattered himself, he said, from my present happy turn, and from my good constitution, that I should live a great many years. It was therefore his request, that I would consent to be <em>his</em> executor; since it was impossible for him to make a better choice, or pursue a better example, than his cousin had set.</p>
				<p>His heart, he said was in it: there were some things in his cousin’s will and <em>his</em> analogous: and he had named one person to me, with whom he was sure I would not refuse to be joined: and to whom he intended to apply for his consent, when he had obtained mine.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-414" id="noteref-414" epub:type="noteref">414</a> [Intimating, as far as I could gather, that it was <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Hickman, son of Sir Charles Hickman; to whom I know your Lordship is not a stranger: for he said, Everyone who was dear to his beloved cousin, must be so to him: and he knew that the gentleman who he had thoughts of, would have, besides my advice and assistance, the advice of one of the most sensible ladies in England.]</p>
				<p>He took my hand, seeing me under some surprise: you must not hesitate, much less deny me, <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Belford. Indeed you must not. Two things I will assure you of: that I have, as I hope, made everything so clear that you cannot have any litigation: and that I have done so justly, and I hope it will be thought so generously, by all my relations, that a mind like yours will rather have pleasure than pain in the execution of this trust. And this is what I think every honest man, who hopes to find an honest man for his executor, should do.</p>
				<p>I told him, that I was greatly obliged to him for his good opinion of me: that it was so much every man’s <em>duty</em> to be an honest man, that it could not be interpreted as vanity to say, that I had no doubt to be found so. But if I accepted of this trust, it must be on condition⁠—</p>
				<p>I could name no condition, he said, interrupting me, which he would refuse to comply with.</p>
				<p>This condition, I told him, was, that as there was as great a probability of <em>his</em> being <em>my</em> survivor, as I his, he would permit me to name <em>him</em> for mine; and, in that case, a week should not pass before I made my will.</p>
				<p>With all his heart, he said; and the readier, as he had no apprehensions of suddenly dying; for what he had done and requested was really the effect of the satisfaction he had taken in the part I had already acted as his cousin’s executor; and in my ability, he was pleased to add: as well as in pursuance of his cousin’s advice in the preamble of her will; to wit; “That this was a work which should be set about in full health, both of body and mind.”</p>
				<p>I told him, that I was pleased to hear him say that he was not in any apprehension of suddenly dying; as this gave me assurance that he had laid aside all thoughts of acting contrary to the dying request of his beloved cousin.</p>
				<p>Does it argue, said he, smiling, that if I were to pursue a vengeance so justifiable in my own opinion, I must be in apprehension of falling by <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Lovelace’s hand?⁠—I will assure you, that I have no fears of that sort⁠—but I know this is an ungrateful subject to you. <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Lovelace is your friend; and I will allow, that a <em>good</em> man may have a friendship for a <em>bad one</em>, so far as to wish him well, without countenancing him in his evil.</p>
				<p>I will assure you, added he, that I have not yet made any resolutions either way. I have told you what force my cousin’s repeated requests have with me. Hitherto they have withheld me⁠—But let us quit this subject.</p>
				<p>This, Sir (giving me a sealed-up parcel) is my will. It is witnessed. I made no doubt of prevailing upon you to do me the requested favour. I have a duplicate to leave with the other gentleman; and an attested copy, which I shall deposit at my banker’s. At my return, which will be in six or eight months at farthest, I will allow you to make an exchange of yours, if you will have it so. I have only now to take leave of my relations in the country. And so God protect you, <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Belford! You will soon hear of me again.</p>
				<p>He then very solemnly embraced me, as I did him: and we parted.</p>
				<p>I heartily congratulate your Lordship on the narrow escape each gentleman has had from the other: for I apprehend that they could not have met without fatal consequences.</p>
				<p>Time, I hope, which subdues all things, will subdue their resentments. I am, my Lord,</p>

				<p>[Several other letters passed between Miss Howe and <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Belford, relating to the disposition of the papers and letters; to the poor’s fund; and to other articles of the Lady’s will: wherein the method of proceeding in each case was adjusted. After which the papers were returned to <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Belford, that he might order the two directed copies of them to be taken.</p>
				<p><em>In one of these letters <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Belford requests Miss Howe to give the character of the friend she so dearly loved</em>: “A task, he imagines, that will be as agreeable to herself, as worthy of her pen.”</p>
				<p>“I am more especially curious to know,” says he, “what was that particular disposition of her time, which I find mentioned in a letter which I have just dipt into, where her sister is enviously reproaching her on that score.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-415" id="noteref-415" epub:type="noteref">415</a> This information may enable me,” says he, “to account for what has often surprised me: how, at so tender an age, this admirable lady became mistress of such extraordinary and such various qualifications.”]</p>
