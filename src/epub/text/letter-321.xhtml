				<p>I have three of thy letters at once before me to answer; in each of which thou complainest of my silence; and in one of them tellest me, that thou canst not live without I scribble to thee every day, or every other day at least.</p>
				<p>Why, then, die, Jack, if thou wilt. What heart, thinkest thou, can I have to write, when I have lost the only subject worth writing upon?</p>
				<p>Help me again to my angel, to my <strong>Clarissa</strong>; and thou shalt have a letter from me, or writing at least part of a letter, every hour. All that the charmer of my heart shall say, that will I put down. Every motion, every air of her beloved person, every look, will I try to describe; and when she is silent, I will endeavour to tell thee her thoughts, either what they are, or what I would have them to be⁠—so that, having <em>her</em>, I shall never want a subject. Having lost her, my whole soul is a blank: the whole creation round me, the elements above, beneath, and everything I <em>behold</em>, (for nothing can I <em>enjoy</em>), are a blank without her.</p>
				<p>Oh! return, return, thou only charmer of my soul! return to thy adoring Lovelace! What is the light, what the air, what the town, what the country, what’s anything, without thee? Light, air, joy, harmony, in my notion, are but parts of thee; and could they be all expressed in one word, that word would be <strong>Clarissa</strong>.</p>
				<p>O my beloved <strong>Clarissa</strong>, return thou then; once more return to bless thy Lovelace, who now, by the loss of thee, knows the value of the jewel he has slighted; and rises every morning but to curse the sun that shines upon everybody but him!</p>
				<hr/>
				<p>Well, but, Jack, ’tis a surprising thing to me, that the dear fugitive cannot be met with; cannot be heard of. She is so poor a plotter, (for plotting is not her talent), that I am confident, had I been at liberty, I should have found her out before now; although the different emissaries I have employed about town, round the adjacent villages, and in Miss Howe’s vicinage, have hitherto failed of success. But my Lord continues so weak and low-spirited, that there is no getting from him. I would not disoblige a man whom I think in danger still: for would his gout, now it has got him down, but give him, like a fair boxer, the rising-blow, all would be over with him. And here (pox of his fondness for me! it happens at a very bad time) he makes me sit hours together entertaining him with my rogueries: (a pretty amusement for a sick man!) and yet, whenever he has the gout, he prays night and morning with his chaplain. But what must <em>his</em> notions of religion be, who after he has nosed and mumbled over his responses, can give a sigh or groan of satisfaction, as if he thought he had made up with Heaven; and return with a new appetite to my stories?⁠—encouraging them, by shaking his sides with laughing at them, and calling me a sad fellow, in such an accent as shows he takes no small delight in his kinsman.</p>
				<p>The old peer has been a sinner in his day, and suffers for it now: a sneaking sinner, <em>sliding</em>, rather than <em>rushing</em> into vices, for fear of his reputation.⁠—Paying for what he never had, and never daring to rise to the joy of an enterprise at first hand, which could bring him within view of a tilting, or of the honour of being considered as a principal man in a court of justice.</p>
				<p>To see such an old Trojan as this, just dropping into the grave, which I hoped ere this would have been dug, and filled up with him; crying out with pain, and grunting with weakness; yet in the same moment crack his leathern face into an horrible laugh, and call a young sinner charming varlet, encoreing him, as formerly he used to do to the Italian eunuchs; what a preposterous, what an unnatural adherence to old habits!</p>
				<p>My two cousins are generally present when I <em>entertain</em>, as the old peer calls it. Those stories must drag horribly, that have not more hearers and applauders than relaters.</p>
				<p>
					<em>Applauders!</em>
				</p>
				<p>Ay, Belford, <em>applauders</em>, repeat I; for although these girls pretend to blame me sometimes for the <em>facts</em>, they praise my manner, my invention, my intrepidity.⁠—Besides, what other people call <em>blame</em>, that call I <em>praise</em>: I ever did; and so I very early discharged <em>shame</em>, that cold-water damper to an enterprising spirit.</p>
				<p>These are smart girls; they have life and wit; and yesterday, upon Charlotte’s raving against me upon a related enterprise, I told her, that I had had in debate several times, whether she were or were not too near of kin to me: and that it was once a moot point with me, whether I could not love her dearly for a month or so: and perhaps it was well for her, that another pretty little puss started up, and diverted me, just as I was entering upon the course.</p>
				<p>They all three held up their hands and eyes at once. But I observed that, though the girls exclaimed against me, they were not so angry at this plain speaking as I have found my beloved upon hints so dark that I have wondered at her quick apprehension.</p>
				<p>I told Charlotte, that, grave as she pretended to be in her <em>smiling</em> resentments on this declaration, I was sure I should not have been put to the expense of above two or three stratagems, (for nobody admired a good invention more than she), could I but have disentangled her conscience from the embarrasses of consanguinity.</p>
				<p>She pretended to be highly displeased: so did her sister for her. I told her, she seemed as much in earnest as if she had thought <em>me</em> so; and <em>dared</em> the trial. Plain words, I said, in these cases, were more shocking to their sex than <i xml:lang="la">gradatim</i> actions. And I bid Patty not be displeased at my distinguishing her sister; since I had a great respect for <em>her</em> likewise.</p>
				<p>An Italian air, in my usual careless way, a half-struggled-for kiss from me, and a shrug of the shoulder, by way of admiration, from each pretty cousin, and sad, sad fellow, from the old peer, attended with a side-shaking laugh, made us all friends.</p>
				<p>There, Jack!⁠—Wilt thou, or wilt thou not, take this for a letter? there’s quantity, I am sure.⁠—How have I filled a sheet (not a shorthand one indeed) without a subject! My fellow shall take this; for he is going to town. And if thou canst think tolerably of such execrable stuff, I will send thee another.</p>
