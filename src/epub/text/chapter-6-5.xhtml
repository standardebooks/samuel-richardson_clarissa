					<p>O Belford! what a hair’s-breadth escape have I had!⁠—Such a one, that I tremble between terror and joy, at the thought of what <em>might</em> have happened, and did not.</p>
					<p>What a perverse girl is this, to contend with her fate; yet has reason to think, that her very stars fight against her! I am the luckiest of me!⁠—But my breath almost fails me, when I reflect upon what a slender thread my destiny hung.</p>
					<p>But not to keep thee in suspense; I have, within this half-hour, obtained possession of the expected letter from Miss Howe⁠—and by <em>such</em> an accident! But here, with the former, I dispatch this; thy messenger waiting.</p>
