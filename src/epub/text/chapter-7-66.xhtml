						<p epub:type="z3998:salutation">Dearest Madam,</p>
					</header>
					<p>All our family is deeply sensible of the injuries you have received at the hands of one of it, whom you only can render in any manner worthy of the relation he stands in to us all: and if, as an act of mercy and charity, the greatest your pious heart can show, you will be pleased to look over his past wickedness and ingratitude, and suffer yourself to be our kinswoman, you will make us the happiest family in the world: and I can engage, that Lord <abbr class="name">M.</abbr>, and Lady Sarah Sadleir, and Lady Betty Lawrance, and my sister, who are all admirers of your virtues, and of your nobleness of mind, will forever love and reverence you, and do everything in all their powers to make you amends for what you have suffered from <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Lovelace. This, Madam, we should not, however, dare to petition for, were we not assured, that <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Lovelace is most sincerely sorry for his past vileness to you; and that he will, on his knees, beg your pardon, and vow eternal love and honour to you.</p>
					<p>Wherefore, <em>my dearest cousin</em>, (how you will charm us all, if this agreeable style may be permitted!) for <em>all</em> our sakes, for his <em>soul’s</em> sake, (you must, I am sure, be so good a lady, as to wish to save a soul!) and allow me to say, for <em>your own fame’s sake</em>, condescend to our joint request: and if, by way of encouragement, you will but say you will be glad to see, and to be as much known personally, as you are by fame, to Charlotte Montague, I will, in two days’ time from the receipt of your permission, wait upon you <em>with</em> or <em>without</em> my sister, and receive your farther commands.</p>
					<p>Let me, <em>our dearest cousin</em>, (we cannot deny ourselves the pleasure of calling you so; let me) entreat you to give me your permission for my journey to London; and put it in the power of Lord <abbr class="name">M.</abbr> and of the ladies of the family, to make you what reparation they <em>can</em> make you, for the injuries which a person of the greatest merit in the world has received from one of the most audacious men in it; and you will infinitely oblige us all; and particularly her, who repeatedly presumes to style herself</p>
