					<p>Do not think, my beloved friend, although you have given me in yours of yesterday a <em>severer</em> instance of what, nevertheless, I must call your <em>impartial</em> love, than ever yet I received from you, that I would be displeased with you for it. That would be to put myself into the inconvenient situation of royalty: that is to say, <em>out of the way</em> of ever being told of my faults; of ever mending them: and <em>in the way</em> of making the sincerest and warmest friendship useless to me.</p>
					<p>And then how brightly, how nobly glows in your bosom the sacred flame of friendship; since it can make you ready to impute to the unhappy sufferer a <em>less degree</em> of warmth in <em>her own</em> cause, than <em>you</em> have for her, because of the endeavours to divest herself of <em>self</em> so far as to leave others to the option which they have a right to make!⁠—Ought I, my dear, to blame, ought I not rather to admire you for this ardor?</p>
					<p>But nevertheless, lest you should think that there is any foundation for a surmise which (although it owe its rise to <em>your</em> friendship) would, if there <em>were</em>, leave me utterly inexcusable, I must, in justice to myself, declare, that I know not my own heart if I have any of that <q>latent</q> or <q>unowned inclination</q>, which you would impute to <q>any other but me</q>. Nor does the <q>important alternative sit lightly on my mind</q>. And yet I must excuse your mother, were it but on this single consideration, that I could not presume to reckon upon her favour, as I could upon <em>her daughter’s</em>, so as to make the claim of friendship upon <em>her</em>, to whom, as the mother of my dearest friend, a veneration is owing, which can hardly be compatible with that sweet familiarity which is one of the indispensable requisites of the sacred tie by which your heart and mine are bound in one.</p>
					<p>What therefore I might expect from my <em>Anna Howe</em>, I <em>ought not</em> from her <em>mother</em>; for would it not be very strange, that a person of her experience should be reflected upon because she gave not up her own judgment, where the consequence of her doing so would be to embroil herself, as she apprehends, with a family she has lived well with, and in behalf of a child against her parents?⁠—as she has moreover a daughter of her own:⁠—a daughter too, give me leave to say, of whose vivacity and charming spirits she is more apprehensive than she need to be, because her truly maternal cares make her fear more from her <em>youth</em>, than she hopes for her <em>prudence</em>; which, nevertheless, she and all the world know to be <em>beyond</em> her years.</p>
					<p>And here let me add, that whatever you may generously, and as the result of an ardent affection for your unhappy friend, urge on this head, in my behalf, or harshly against anyone who may refuse me protection in the extraordinary circumstances I find myself in, I have some pleasure in being able to curb undue expectations upon my indulgent friends, whatever were to befall myself from those circumstances, for I should be extremely mortified, were I by my selfish forwardness to give occasion for such a check, as to be told, that I had encouraged an unreasonable hope, or, according to the phrase you mention, wished to take <q>a thorn out of my own foot, and to put in to that of my friend</q>. Nor should I be better pleased with myself, if, having been taught by my good <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Norton, that the best of schools is <q>that of affliction</q>, I should rather learn impatience than the contrary, by the lessons I am obliged to get by heart in it; and if I should judge of the <q>merits of others</q>, as they were <q>kind to me</q>; and that at the expense of their own convenience or peace of mind. For is not this to suppose myself ever in the right; and all who do not act as I would have them act, perpetually in the wrong? In short, to make <em>my</em> sake <em>God’s</em> sake, in the sense of <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Solmes’s pitiful plea to me?</p>
					<p>How often, my dear, have you and I endeavoured to detect and censure this partial spirit in others?</p>
					<p>But I know you do not always content yourself with saying what you think may <em>justly</em> be said; but, in order to show the extent of a penetration which can go to the bottom of any subject, delight to say or to write all that <em>can</em> be <em>said</em> or <em>written</em>, or even <em>thought</em>, on the particular occasion; and this partly perhaps from being desirous (pardon me, my dear!) to be thought mistress of a sagacity that is aforehand with events. But who would wish to drain off or dry up a refreshing current, because it now-and-then puts us to some little inconvenience by its over-flowings? In other words, who would not allow for the liveliness of a spirit which for one painful sensibility gives an hundred pleasurable ones; and the <em>one</em> in consequence of the <em>other</em>?</p>
					<p>But now I come to the two points in your letter, which most sensibly concern me: Thus you put them:</p>
					<blockquote epub:type="z3998:letter">
						<p>“Whether I choose not rather to go off (shocking words!) with one of my <em>own sex</em>; with my <strong>Anna Howe</strong>⁠—than with one of the <em>other</em>; with <strong><abbr>Mr.</abbr> Lovelace</strong>?”</p>
						<p>And if <em>not</em>,</p>
						<p>“Whether I should not marry him as soon as possible?”</p>
					</blockquote>
					<p>You know, my dear, my reasons for rejecting your proposal, and even for being earnest that you should not be <em>known</em> to be assisting me in an enterprise in which a cruel necessity induced <em>me</em> to think of engaging; and for which <em>you</em> have not the same plea. At this rate, <em>well</em> might your mother be uneasy at our correspondence, not knowing to what inconveniencies it might subject her and you!⁠—If <em>I</em> am hardly excusable to think of withdrawing from my <em>unkind</em> friends, what could you have to say for yourself, were you to abandon a mother so <em>indulgent</em>? Does she suspect that your fervent friendship may lead you to a <em>small</em> indiscretion? and does this suspicion offend you? And would you, in resentment, show her and the world, that you can voluntarily rush into the <em>highest error</em> that any of our sex can be guilty of?</p>
					<p>And is it worthy of your generosity (I ask you, my dear, is it?) to think of taking so undutiful a step, because you believe your mother would be glad to receive you again?</p>
					<p>I do assure you, that were I to take this step myself, I would run all risks rather than you should accompany me in it. Have I, do you think, a desire to <em>double</em> and <em>treble</em> my own fault in the eye of the world? in the eye of that world which, cruelly as I am used, (not knowing all,) would not acquit me?</p>
					<p>But, my dearest, kindest friend, let me tell you, that we will <em>neither</em> of us take such a step. The manner of putting your questions abundantly convinces me, that I ought not, in <em>your</em> opinion, to <em>attempt</em> it. You no doubt <em>intend</em> that I shall <em>so</em> take it; and I thank you for the equally polite and forcible conviction.</p>
					<p>It is some satisfaction to me (taking the matter in this light) that I had begun to waver before I received your last. And now I tell you, that it has absolutely determined me not to go off; at least not tomorrow.</p>
					<p>If <em>you</em>, my dear, think <q>the issue of the alternative</q> (to use your own words) <q>sits so lightly upon my mind</q>, in short, that my <q>inclination</q> is <em>faulty</em>; the <em>world</em> would treat me much less scrupulously. When therefore you represent, <q>that all punctilio must be at an end the moment I am out of my father’s house; and hint</q>, that I must submit it to <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Lovelace to judge <em>when</em> he can leave me with safety; that is to say, give <em>him</em> the option whether he will leave me, or not; who can bear these reflections, who can resolve to incur these inconveniencies, that has the question still in her own power to decide upon?</p>
					<p>While I thought only of an escape from <em>this house</em> as an escape from <em><abbr>Mr.</abbr> Solmes</em>; that already my reputation suffered by my confinement; and that it would be in my own option either to marry <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Lovelace, or wholly to renounce him; bold as the step was, I thought, treated as I am treated, something was to be said in excuse of it⁠—if not to the world, to <em>myself</em>: and to be <em>self-acquitted</em>, is a blessing to be preferred to the option of all the world. But, after I have censured most severely, as I have ever done, those giddy girls, who have in the same hour, as I may say, that they have fled from their chamber, presented themselves at the altar that is witness to their undutiful rashness; after I have stipulated with <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Lovelace <q>for time</q>, and for <q>an ultimate option whether to accept or refuse him</q>; and for his <q>leaving me, as soon as I am in a place of safety</q> (which, as you observe, <em>he</em> must be the judge of); and after he has <q>signified to me his compliance with these terms</q>; so that I cannot, if I <em>would</em>, recall them, and suddenly marry;⁠—you see, my dear, that I have nothing left me but to resolve <em>not</em> to go away with him!</p>
					<p>But, how, on this revocation of my appointment, shall I be able to pacify him?</p>
					<p>How!⁠—Why assert the privilege of my sex!⁠—Surely, on <em>this</em> side of the solemnity he has no <em>right</em> to be displeased. Besides, did I not reserve a power of receding, as I saw fit? To what purpose, as I asked in the case between your mother and you, has anybody an option, if the making use of it shall give the refused a right to be disgusted?</p>
					<p>Far, very far, would <em>those</em>, who, according to the old law, have a <em>right</em> of <em>absolving</em> or <em>confirming</em> a child’s promise, be from ratifying <em>mine</em>, had it been ever so <em>solemn</em> a one.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-50" id="noteref-50" epub:type="noteref">50</a> But this was rather an <em>appointment</em> than a promise: and suppose it had been the latter; and that I had <em>not</em> reserved to myself a liberty of revoking it; was it to preclude <em>better</em> or <em>maturer</em> consideration?⁠—If so, how unfit to be given!⁠—how ungenerous to be insisted upon!⁠—And how unfitter still to be kept!⁠—Is there a man living who ought to be angry that a woman whom he hopes one day to call his, shall refuse to keep a rash promise, when, on the maturest deliberation, she is convinced that it <em>was</em> a rash one?</p>
					<p>I resolve then, upon the whole, to stand this one trial of Wednesday next⁠—or, perhaps, I should rather say, of Tuesday evening, if my father hold his purpose of endeavouring, in person, to make me <em>read</em>, or <em>hear</em> read, and then <em>sign</em>, the settlements.⁠—<em>That, that</em> must be the greatest trial of all.</p>
					<p>If I am compelled to sign them overnight⁠—then (the Lord bless me!) must all I dread follow, as of course, on Wednesday. If I can prevail upon them by my prayers (perhaps I shall fall into fits; for the very first appearance of my father, after having been so long banished his presence, will greatly affect me⁠—if, I say, I can prevail upon them by my prayers) to lay aside their views; or to suspend the day, if but for one week; but if <em>not</em>, but for two or three days; still Wednesday will be a lighter day of trial. They will surely give me time to <em>consider</em>: to <em>argue</em> with myself. This will not be <em>promising</em>. As I have made no effort to get away, they have no reason to suspect me; so I may have an opportunity, in the last resort, to withdraw. <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Norton is to be with me: she, although she should be chidden for it, will, in my extremity, plead for me. My aunt Hervey may, in such an extremity, join with her. Perhaps my mother may be brought over. I will kneel to each, one by one, to make a friend. Some of them have been afraid to see me, lest they should be moved in my favour: does not this give a reasonable hope that I may move them? My brother’s counsel, heretofore given, to turn me out of doors to my evil destiny, may again be repeated, and may prevail; <em>then</em> shall I be in no worse case than <em>now</em>, as to the displeasure of my friends; and thus far <em>better</em>, that it will not be my fault that I seek another protection: which even <em>then</em> ought to be my cousin Morden’s, rather than <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Lovelace’s, or any other person’s.</p>
					<p>My heart, in short, misgives me less, when I resolve <em>this</em> way, than when I think of the <em>other</em>: and in so strong and involuntary a bias, the <em>heart</em> is, as I may say, conscience. And well cautions the wise man: “Let the counsel of thine own heart stand; for there is no man more faithful to thee than it: for a man’s mind is sometimes wont to tell him more than seven watchmen, that sit above in a high tower.”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-51" id="noteref-51" epub:type="noteref">51</a></p>
					<p>Forgive these indigested self-reasonings. I will close here: and instantly set about a letter of revocation to <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Lovelace; take it as he will. It will only be another trial of temper to <em>him</em>. To <em>me</em> of infinite importance. And has he not promised temper and acquiescence, on the supposition of a change in my mind?</p>
