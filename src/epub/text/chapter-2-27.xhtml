					<p>You incense, alarm, and terrify me, at the same time.⁠—Hasten, my dearest friend, hasten to me what further intelligence you can gather about this vilest of men.</p>
					<p>But never talk of innocence, of simplicity, and this unhappy girl, together! Must she not know, that such a man as that, dignified in his very aspect; and no disguise able to conceal his being of condition; must mean too much, when he places her at the upper end of his table, and calls her by such tender names? Would a girl, modest as simple, above seventeen, be set a-singing at the pleasure of such a man as that? a stranger, and professedly in disguise!⁠—Would her father and grandmother, if honest people, and careful of their simple girl, permit such freedoms?</p>
					<p><em>Keep his friend at a distance from her!</em>⁠—To be sure his <em>designs</em> are villainous, if they have not been already effected.</p>
					<p>Warn, my dear, if not too late, the unthinking father, of his child’s danger. There cannot be a father in the world, who would sell his child’s virtue. Nor mother!⁠—The poor thing!</p>
					<p>I long to hear the result of your intelligence. You shall <em>see</em> the simple creature, you tell me.⁠—Let me know what sort of a girl she is.⁠—A sweet pretty girl! you say. A <q>sweet pretty girl</q>, my dear!⁠—They are sweet pretty words from your pen. But are they <em>yours</em> or <em>his</em> of her?⁠—If she be so simple, if she have ease and nature in her manner, in her speech, and warbles prettily her <em>wild notes</em>, why, such a girl as that must engage such a profligate wretch, (as now indeed I doubt this man is,) accustomed, perhaps, to town women, and their confident ways.⁠—Must <em>deeply</em> and for a <em>long season</em> engage him: since perhaps when her innocence is departed, she will endeavour by art to supply the loss of the natural charms which now engage him.</p>
					<p>Fine hopes of such a wretch’s reformation! I would not, my dear, for the world, have anything to say⁠—but I need not make resolutions. I have not opened, nor will I open, his letter.⁠—A sycophant creature!⁠—With his hoarsenesses⁠—got perhaps by a midnight revel, singing to his wild note singer, and only increased in the coppice!</p>
					<p>To be already on a footing!⁠—In <em>his</em> esteem, I mean: for myself, I despise him. I hate myself almost for writing so much about <em>him</em>, and of such a simpleton as <q>this sweet pretty girl</q> as you call her: but no one can be either <em>sweet</em> or <em>pretty</em>, that is not modest, that is not virtuous.</p>
					<p>And now, my dear, I will tell you how I came to put you upon this inquiry.</p>
					<p>This vile <em>Joseph Leman</em> had given a hint to <em>Betty</em>, and she to <em>me</em>, as if Lovelace would be found out to be a very bad man, at a place where he had been lately seen in disguise. But he would see further, he said, before he told her more; and she promised <em>secrecy</em>, in hope to get at <q>further intelligence</q>. I thought it could be no harm, to get you to inform yourself, and me, of what could be gathered.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-40" id="noteref-40" epub:type="noteref">40</a> And now I see, his enemies are but too well warranted in their reports of him: and, if the ruin of this poor young creature be his aim, and if he had not known her but for his visits to Harlowe-place, I shall have reason to be doubly concerned for her; and doubly incensed against so vile a man.</p>
					<p>I think I hate him worse than I do Solmes himself.</p>
					<p>But I will not add one more word about him; and after I have told you, that I wish to know, as soon as possible what further occurs from your inquiry. I have a letter from him; but shall not open it till I do: and then, if it come out as I dare say it will, I will directly put the letter unopened into the place I took it from, and never trouble myself more about him. Adieu, my dearest friend.</p>
