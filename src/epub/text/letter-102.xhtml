				</header>
				<p>I have, I confess, been guilty of an action which carries with it a rash and undutiful appearance. And I should have thought it an inexcusable one, had I been used with less severity than I have been of late; and had I not had too great reason to apprehend, that I was to be made a sacrifice to a man I could not bear to think of. But what is done, is done⁠—perhaps I could wish it had not; and that I had trusted to the relenting of my dear and honourable parents.⁠—Yet this from no other motives but those of duty to them.⁠—To whom I am ready to return (if I may not be permitted to retire to The Grove) on conditions which I before offered to comply with.</p>
				<p>Nor shall I be in any sort of dependence upon the person by whose means I have taken this <em>truly-reluctant step</em>, inconsistent with any reasonable engagement I shall enter into, if I am not further precipitated. Let me not have it to say, now at this important crisis! that I have a sister, but not a friend in that sister. My reputation, dearer to me than life, (whatever you may imagine from the step I have taken), is suffering. A little lenity will, even yet, in a great measure, restore it, and make that pass for a temporary misunderstanding only, which otherwise will be a stain as durable as life, upon a creature who has already been treated with great <em>unkindness</em>, to use no harsher a word.</p>
				<p>For your own sake therefore, for my brother’s sake, by whom (I must say) I have been thus precipitated, and for all the family’s sake, aggravate not my fault, if, on recollecting everything, you think it one; nor by widening the unhappy difference, expose a sister forever⁠—prays</p>
