				<p>About six this morning, I went to Rowland’s. <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mrs.</abbr> Sinclair was to follow me, in order to dismiss the action; but not to come in sight.</p>
				<p>Rowland, upon inquiry, told me, that the lady was extremely ill; and that she had desired, that no one but his wife or maid should come near her.</p>
				<p>I said, I <em>must</em> see her. I had told him my business overnight, and I must see her.</p>
				<p>His wife went up: but returned presently, saying, she could not get her to speak to her; yet that her eyelids moved; though she either would not, or could not, open them, to look up at her.</p>
				<p>Oons, woman, said I, the lady may be in a fit: the lady may be dying⁠—let me go up. Show me the way.</p>
				<p>A horrid hole of a house, in an alley they call a court; stairs wretchedly narrow, even to the first-floor rooms: and into a den they led me, with broken walls, which had been papered, as I saw by a multitude of tacks, and some torn bits held on by the rusty heads.</p>
				<p>The floor indeed was clean, but the ceiling was smoked with variety of figures, and initials of names, that had been the woeful employment of wretches who had no other way to amuse themselves.</p>
				<p>A bed at one corner, with coarse curtains tacked up at the feet to the ceiling; because the curtain-rings were broken off; but a coverlid upon it with a cleanish look, though plaguily in tatters, and the corners tied up in tassels, that the rents in it might go no farther.</p>
				<p>The windows dark and double-barred, the tops boarded up to save mending; and only a little four-paned eyelet-hole of a casement to let in air; more, however, coming in at broken panes than could come in at that.</p>
				<p>Four old Turkey-worked chairs, bursten-bottomed, the stuffing staring out.</p>
				<p>An old, tottering, worm-eaten table, that had more nails bestowed in mending it to make it stand, than the table cost fifty years ago, when new.</p>
				<p>On the mantelpiece was an iron shove-up candlestick, with a lighted candle in it, twinkle, twinkle, twinkle, four of them, I suppose, for a penny.</p>
				<p>Near that, on the same shelf, was an old looking-glass, cracked through the middle, breaking out into a thousand points; the crack given it, perhaps, in a rage, by some poor creature, to whom it gave the representation of his heart’s woes in his face.</p>
				<p>The chimney had two half-tiles in it on one side, and one whole one on the other; which showed it had been in better plight; but now the very mortar had followed the rest of the tiles in every other place, and left the bricks bare.</p>
				<p>An old half-barred stove grate was in the chimney; and in that a large stone-bottle without a neck, filled with baleful yew, as an evergreen, withered southern-wood, dead sweetbriar, and sprigs of rue in flower.</p>
				<p>To finish the shocking description, in a dark nook stood an old broken-bottomed cane couch, without a squab, or coverlid, sunk at one corner, and unmortised by the failing of one of its worm-eater legs, which lay in two pieces under the wretched piece of furniture it could no longer support.</p>
				<p>
					<em>And this, thou horrid Lovelace, was the bedchamber of the divine Clarissa!!!</em>
				</p>
				<p>I had leisure to cast my eye on these things: for, going up softly, the poor lady turned not about at our entrance; nor, till I spoke, moved her head.</p>
				<p>She was kneeling in a corner of the room, near the dismal window, against the table, on an old bolster (as it seemed to be) of the cane couch, half-covered with her handkerchief; her back to the door; which was only shut to, (no need of fastenings); her arms crossed upon the table, the forefinger of her right-hand in her Bible. She had perhaps been reading in it, and could read no longer. Paper, pens, ink, lay by her book on the table. Her dress was white damask, exceeding neat; but her stays seemed not tight-laced. I was told afterwards, that her laces had been cut, when she fainted away at her entrance into this cursed place; and she had not been solicitous enough about her dress to send for others. Her headdress was a little discomposed; her charming hair, in natural ringlets, as you have heretofore described it, but a little tangled, as if not lately combed, irregularly shading one side of the loveliest neck in the world; as her disordered rumpled handkerchief did the other. Her face (O how altered from what I had seen it! yet lovely in spite of all her griefs and sufferings!) was reclined, when we entered, upon her crossed arms; but so, as not more than one side of it could be hid.</p>
				<p>When I surveyed the room around, and the kneeling lady, sunk with majesty too in her white flowing robes, (for she had not on a hoop), spreading the dark, though not dirty, floor, and illuminating that horrid corner; her linen beyond imagination white, considering that she had not been undressed every since she had been here; I thought my concern would have choked me. Something rose in my throat, I know not what, which made me, for a moment, guggle, as it were, for speech: which, at last, forcing its way, con⁠—con⁠—confound you both, said I, to the man and woman, is this an apartment for such a lady? and could the cursed devils of her own sex, who visited this suffering angel, see her, and leave her, in so d⁠⸺⁠d a nook?</p>
				<p>Sir, we would have had the lady to accept of our own bedchamber: but she refused it. We are poor people⁠—and we expect nobody will stay with us longer than they can help it.</p>
				<p>You are people chosen purposely, I doubt not, by the d⁠⸺⁠d woman who has employed you: and if your usage of this lady has been but half as bad as your house, you had better never to have seen the light.</p>
				<p>Up then raised the charming sufferer her lovely face; but with such a significance of woe overspreading it, that I could not, for the soul of me, help being visibly affected.</p>
				<p>She waved her hand two or three times towards the door, as if commanding me to withdraw; and displeased at my intrusion; but did not speak.</p>
				<p>Permit me, Madam⁠—I will not approach one step farther without your leave⁠—permit me, for one moment, the favour of your ear!</p>
				<p>No⁠—no⁠—go, go, <strong>man</strong>! with an emphasis⁠—and would have said more; but, as if struggling in vain for words, she seemed to give up speech for lost, and dropped her head down once more, with a deep sigh, upon her left arm; her right, as if she had not the use of it (numbed, I suppose) self-moved, dropping on her side.</p>
				<p>O that thou hadst been there! and in my place!⁠—But by what I then felt, in myself, I am convinced, that a capacity of being moved by the distresses of our fellow creatures, is far from being disgraceful to a manly heart. With what pleasure, at that moment, could I have given up my own life, could I but first have avenged this charming creature, and cut the throat of her <em>destroyer</em>, as she emphatically calls thee, though the friend that I best love: and yet, at the same time, my heart and my eyes gave way to a softness of which (though not so hardened a wretch as thou) they were never before so susceptible.</p>
				<p>I dare not approach you, dearest lady, without your leave: but on my knees I beseech you to permit me to release you from this d⁠⸺⁠d house, and out of the power of the cursed woman, who was the occasion of your being here!</p>
				<p>She lifted up her sweet face once more, and beheld me on my knees. Never knew I before what it was to pray so heartily.</p>
				<p>Are you not⁠—are you not <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Belford, Sir? I think your name is Belford?</p>
				<p>It is, Madam, and I ever was a worshipper of your virtues, and an advocate for you; and I come to release you from the hands you are in.</p>
				<p>And in whose to place me?⁠—O leave me, leave me! let me never rise from this spot! let me never, never more believe in man!</p>
				<p>This moment, dearest lady, this very moment, if you please, you may depart whithersoever you think fit. You are absolutely free, and your own mistress.</p>
				<p>I had now as lieve die here in this place, as anywhere. I will owe no obligation to any friend of <em>him</em> in whose company you have seen me. So, pray, Sir, withdraw.</p>
				<p>Then turning to the officer, <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Rowland I think your name is? I am better reconciled to your house than I was at first. If you can but engage that I shall have nobody come near me but your wife, (no <em>man</em>!) and neither of those women who have sported with my calamities, I will die with you, and in this very corner. And you shall be well satisfied for the trouble you have had with me⁠—I have value enough for that⁠—for, see, I have a diamond ring; taking it out of her bosom; and I have friends will redeem it at a high price, when I am gone.</p>
				<p>But for <em>you</em>, Sir, looking at me, I beg you to withdraw. If you mean well by me, God, I hope, will reward you for your good meaning; but to the friend of my <em>destroyer</em> will I not owe an obligation.</p>
				<p>You will owe no obligation to me, nor to anybody. You have been detained for a debt you do not owe. The action is dismissed; and you will only be so good as to give me your hand into the coach, which stands as near to this house as it could draw up. And I will either leave you at the coach-door, or attend you whithersoever you please, till I see you safe where you would wish to be.</p>
				<p>Will you then, Sir, <em>compel</em> me to be beholden to you?</p>
				<p>You will inexpressibly oblige me, Madam, to command me to do you either service or pleasure.</p>
				<p>Why then, Sir, (looking at me)⁠—but why do you mock me in that humble posture! Rise, Sir! I cannot speak to you else.</p>
				<p>I rose.</p>
				<p>Only, Sir, take this ring. I have a sister, who will be glad to have it, at the price it shall be valued at, for the <em>former</em> owner’s sake!⁠—Out of the money she gives, let this man be paid! handsomely paid: and I have a few valuables more at my lodging, (Dorcas, or the Man William, can tell where that is); let them, and my clothes at the wicked woman’s, where you have seen me, be sold for the payment of my lodging first, and next of your <em>friend’s</em> debts, that I have been arrested for, as far as they will go; only reserving enough to put me into the ground, anywhere, or anyhow, no matter⁠—Tell your friend, I wish it may be enough to satisfy the whole demand; but if it be not, he must make it up himself; or, if he think fit to draw for it on Miss Howe, she will repay it, <em>and with interest</em>, if he insist upon it.⁠—And this, Sir, if you promise to perform, you will do me, as you offer, both pleasure and service: and say you <em>will</em>, and take the ring and withdraw. If I want to say anything more to you (you seem to be an humane man) I will let you know⁠—and so, Sir, God bless you!</p>
				<p>I approached her, and was going to speak⁠—</p>
				<p>Don’t speak, Sir: here’s the ring.</p>
				<p>I stood off.</p>
				<p>And won’t you take it? won’t you do this last office for me?⁠—I have no other person to ask it of; else, believe me, I would not request it of you. But take it, or not, laying it upon the table⁠—you must withdraw, Sir: I am very ill. I would fain get a little rest, if I could. I find I am going to be bad again.</p>
				<p>And offering to rise, she sunk down through excess of weakness and grief, in a fainting fit.</p>
				<p>Why, Lovelace, was thou not present thyself?⁠—Why dost thou commit such villainies, as even thou art afraid to appear in; and yet puttest a weaker heart and head upon encountering with them?</p>
				<p>The maid coming in just then, the woman and she lifted her up on a decrepit couch; and I withdrew with this Rowland; who wept like a child, and said, he never in his life was so moved.</p>
				<p>
					<em>Yet so hardened a wretch art thou, that I question whether thou wilt shed a tear at my relation.</em>
				</p>
				<p>They recovered her by hartshorn and water. I went down meanwhile; for the detestable woman had been below some time. O how I did curse her! I never before was so fluent in curses.</p>
				<p>She tried to wheedle me; but I renounced her; and, after she had dismissed the action, sent her away crying, or pretending to cry, because of my behaviour to her.</p>
				<p>You will observe, that I did not mention one word to the lady about <em>you</em>. I was afraid to do it. For ’twas plain, that she could not bear your name: your <em>friend</em>, and the <em>company</em> you have seen me in, were the words nearest to naming you she could speak: and yet I wanted to clear your intention of this brutal, this sordid-looking villany.</p>
				<p>I sent up again, by Rowland’s wife, when I heard that the lady was recovered, beseeching her to quit that devilish place; and the woman assured her that she was at liberty to do so, for that the action was dismissed.</p>
				<p>But she cared not to answer her: and was so weak and low, that it was almost as much out of her power as inclination, the woman told me, to speak.</p>
				<p>I would have hastened away for my friend Doctor <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">H.</abbr>, but the house is such a den, and the room she was in such a hole, that I was ashamed to be seen in it by a man of his reputation, especially with a woman of such an appearance, and in such uncommon distress; and I found there was no prevailing upon her to quit it for the people’s bedroom, which was neat and lightsome.</p>
				<p>The strong room she was in, the wretches told me, should have been in better order, but that it was but the very morning that she was brought in that an unhappy man had quitted it; for a more eligible prison, no doubt; since there could hardly be a worse.</p>
				<p>Being told that she desired not to be disturbed, and seemed inclined to doze, I took this opportunity to go to her lodgings in Covent-garden: to which Dorcas (who first discovered her there, as Will was the setter from church) had before given me a direction.</p>
				<p>The man’s name is Smith, a dealer in gloves, snuff, and such petty merchandize: his wife the shopkeeper: he a maker of the gloves they sell. Honest people, it seems.</p>
				<p>I thought to have got the woman with me to the lady; but she was not within.</p>
				<p>I talked with the man, and told him what had befallen the lady; owing, as I said, to a mistake of orders; and gave her the character she deserved; and desired him to send his wife, the moment she came in, to the lady; directing him whither; not doubting that her attendance would be very welcome to her; which he promised.</p>
				<p>He told me that a letter was left for her there on Saturday; and, about half an hour before I came, another, superscribed by the same hand; the first, by the post; the other, by a countryman; who having been informed of her absence, and of all the circumstances they could tell him of it, posted away, full of concern, saying, that the lady he was sent from would be ready to break her heart at the tidings.</p>
				<p>I thought it right to take the two letters back with me; and, dismissing my coach, took a chair, as a more proper vehicle for the lady, if I (the friend of her <em>destroyer</em>) could prevail upon her to leave Rowland’s.</p>
				<p>And here, being obliged to give way to an indispensable avocation, I will make thee taste a little, in thy turn, of the plague of suspense; and break off, without giving thee the least hint of the issue of my further proceedings. I know, that those least bear disappointment, who love most to give it. In twenty instances, hast thou afforded me proof of the truth of this observation. And I matter not thy raving.</p>
				<p>Another letter, however, shall be ready, send for it a soon as thou wilt. But, were it not, have I not written enough to convince thee, that I am</p>
