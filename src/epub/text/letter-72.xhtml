				<p>Justice obliges me to forward this after my last on the wings of the wind, as I may say. I really believe the man is innocent. Of this one accusation, I think he must be acquitted; and I am sorry I was so forward in dispatching away my intelligence by halves.</p>
				<p>I have seen the girl. She is really a very pretty, a very neat, and, what is still a greater beauty, a very innocent young creature. He who could have ruined such an undersigned home-bred, must have been indeed infernally wicked. Her father is an honest simple man; entirely satisfied with his child, and with her new acquaintance.</p>
				<p>I am almost afraid for your heart, when I tell you, that I find, now I have got to the bottom of this inquiry, something noble come out in this Lovelace’s favour.</p>
				<p>The girl is to be married next week; and this promoted and brought about by him. He is resolved, her father says, to make one couple happy, and wishes he could make more so (<em>There’s for you, my dear!</em>) And she professes to love, he has given her an hundred pounds: the grandmother actually has it in her hands, to answer to the like sum given to the youth by one of his own relation: while <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Lovelace’s companion, attracted by the example, has given twenty-five guineas to the father, who is poor, towards clothes to equip the pretty rustic.</p>
				<p><abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Lovelace and his friend, the poor man says, when they first came to his house, affected to appear as <q>persons of low degree</q>; but now he knows the one (but mentioned it in confidence) to be Colonel Barrow, the other Captain Sloane. The colonel he owns was at first very <q>sweet upon his girl</q>: but her grandmother’s begging of him to spare her innocence, he vowed, that he never would offer anything but good counsel to her. He kept his word; and the pretty fool acknowledged, that she never could have been better instructed by the minister himself from the <em>bible-book</em>!⁠—The girl pleased me so well, that I made her visit to me worth her while.</p>
				<p>But what, my dear, will become of us now?⁠—Lovelace not only reformed, but turned preacher!⁠—What will become of us now?⁠—Why, my sweet friend, your <em>generosity</em> is now engaged in his favour!⁠—Fie upon this <em>generosity</em>! I think in my heart, that it does as much mischief to the noble-minded, as <em>love</em> to the ignobler.⁠—What before was only a <q>conditional liking</q>, I am now afraid will turn to <q>liking unconditional</q>.</p>
				<p>I could not endure to change my invective into panegyric all at once, and so soon. We, or such as I at least, love to keep ourselves in countenance for a rash judgment, even when we know it to be rash. Everybody has not your generosity in confessing a mistake. It requires a greatness of soul frankly to do it. So I made still further inquiry after his life and manner, and behaviour there, in hopes to find something bad: but all uniform!</p>
				<p>Upon the whole, <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Lovelace comes out with so much advantage from this inquiry, that were there the least room for it, I should suspect the whole to be <em>a plot set on foot to wash a blackamoor white</em>. Adieu, my dear.</p>
