					<p epub:type="se:letter.dateline">Thursday, <time datetime="09-28"><abbr>Sept.</abbr> 28</time></p>
					<p epub:type="z3998:salutation">Madam,</p>
				</header>
				<p>I do myself the honour to send you by this, according to my promise,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-411" id="noteref-411" epub:type="noteref">411</a> copies of the posthumous letters written by your exalted friend.</p>
				<p>These will be accompanied with other letters, particularly a copy of one from <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Lovelace, begun to be written on the <time datetime="09-14">14th</time>, and continued down to the <time datetime="09-18">18th</time>.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-412" id="noteref-412" epub:type="noteref">412</a> You will see by it, Madam, the dreadful anguish that his spirits labour with, and his deep remorse.</p>
				<p><abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Lovelace sent for this letter back. I complied; but I first took a copy of it. As I have not told him that I have done so, you will be pleased to forbear communicating of it to anybody but <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Hickman. That gentleman’s perusal of it will be the same as if nobody but yourself saw it.</p>
				<p>One of the letters of Colonel Morden, which I enclose, you will observe, Madam, is only a copy.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-413" id="noteref-413" epub:type="noteref">413</a> The true reason for which, as I will ingenuously acknowledge, is, some free, but respectful animadversions which the Colonel has made upon your declining to carry into execution your part of your dear friend’s last requests. I have therefore, in respect to that worthy gentleman, (having a caution from <em>him</em> on that head), omitted those parts.</p>
				<p>Will you allow me, Madam, however, to tell you, that I myself could not have believed that my inimitable testatrix’s own Miss Howe would have been the most backward in performing such a part of her dear friend’s last will, as is entirely in her own power to perform⁠—especially, when that performance would make <q>one of the most deserving men in England happy</q>; and whom, I presume, she <em>proposes</em> to honour with her hand.</p>
				<p>Excuse me, Madam, I have a most sincere veneration for you; and would not disoblige you for the world.</p>
				<p>I will not presume to make remarks on the letters I send you; nor upon the informations I have to give you of the dreadful end of two unhappy wretches who were the greatest criminals in the affair of your adorable friend. These are the infamous <em>Sinclair</em>, and a person whom you have read of, no doubt, in the letters of the charming innocent, by the name of Captain <em>Tomlinson</em>.</p>
				<p>The wretched woman died in the extremest tortures and despondency: the man from wounds got in defending himself in carrying on a contraband trade; both accusing themselves, in their last hours, for the parts they had acted against the most excellent of women, as of the crime that gave them the deepest remorse.</p>
				<p>Give me leave to say, Madam, that if your <em>compassion</em> be not excited for the poor man who suffers so greatly from his own anguish of mind, as you will observe by his letter he does; and for the unhappy family, whose remorse, you will see by Colonel Morden’s, is so deep; your <em>terror</em> must. And yet I should not wonder, if the just sense of the irreparable loss you have sustained hardens a heart against pity, which, on a less extraordinary occasion, would want its <em>principal grace</em>, if it were not compassionate.</p>
				<p>I am, Madam, with the greatest respect and gratitude,</p>
