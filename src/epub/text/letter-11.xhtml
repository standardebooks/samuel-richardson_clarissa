				<p>You both nettled and alarmed me, my dearest Miss Howe, by the concluding part of your last. At first reading it, I did not think it necessary, said I to myself, to guard against a critic, when I was writing to so dear a friend. But then recollecting myself, is there not more in it, said I, than the result of a vein so naturally lively? Surely I must have been guilty of an inadvertence. Let me enter into the close examination of myself which my beloved friend advises.</p>
				<p>I do so; and cannot own any of the <em>glow</em>, any of the <em>throbs</em> you mention.⁠—<em>Upon my word</em> I will repeat, I cannot. And yet the passages in my letter, upon which you are so humorously severe, lay me fairly open to your agreeable raillery. I own they do. And I cannot tell what turn my mind had taken to dictate so oddly to my pen.</p>
				<p>But, pray now⁠—is it saying so much, when one, who has no very particular regard to <em>any</em> man, says, there are some who are preferable to <em>others</em>? And is it blamable to say, <em>they</em> are the preferable, who are not well used by one’s relations; yet dispense with <em>that</em> usage out of regard to one’s self which they would otherwise resent? <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Lovelace, for instance, I may be allowed to say, is a man to be preferred to <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Solmes; and that I <em>do</em> prefer him to that man: but, surely, this may be said without its being a necessary consequence that I must be in love with him.</p>
				<p>Indeed I would not be <em>in love</em> with him, as it is called, for the world: First, because I have no opinion of his morals; and think it a fault in which our whole family (my brother excepted) has had a share, that he was permitted to visit us with a hope, which, however, being distant, did not, as I have observed heretofore,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-6" id="noteref-6" epub:type="noteref">6</a> entitle any of us to call him to account for such of his immoralities as came to our ears. Next, because I think him to be a vain man, capable of triumphing (secretly at least) over a person whose heart he thinks he has engaged. And, thirdly, because the assiduities and veneration which you impute to him, seem to carry an haughtiness in them, as if he thought his address had a merit in it, that would be more than an equivalent to a woman’s love. In short, his very politeness, notwithstanding the advantages he must have had from his birth and education, appear to be constrained; and, with the most remarkable easy and genteel person, something, at times, seems to be behind in his <em>manner</em> that is too studiously kept in. Then, good-humoured as he is thought to be in the main to <em>other people’s</em> servants, and this even to familiarity (although, as you have observed, a familiarity that has dignity in it not unbecoming to a man of quality) he is apt sometimes to break out into a passion with <em>his own</em>: An oath or a curse follows, and such looks from those servants as plainly show terror, and that they should have fared worse had they not been in my hearing: with a confirmation in the master’s looks of a surmise too well justified.</p>
				<p>Indeed, my dear, <strong>this</strong> man is not <strong>the</strong> man. I have great objections to him. My heart <em>throbs</em> not after him. I <em>glow</em> not, but with indignation against myself for having given room for such an imputation. But you must not, my dearest friend, construe common gratitude into love. I cannot bear that you should. But if ever I should have the misfortune to think it love, I promise you <em>upon my word</em>, which is the same as <em>upon my honour</em>, that I will acquaint you with it.</p>
				<p>You bid me to tell you very speedily, and by the newfound expedient, that I am not displeased with you for your agreeable raillery: I dispatch this therefore immediately, postponing to my next the account of the inducements which my friends have to promote with so much earnestness the address of <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Solmes.</p>
				<p>Be satisfied, my dear, meantime, that I am not displeased with you: indeed I am not. On the contrary, I give you my hearty thanks for your friendly premonitions; and I charge you (as I have often done) that if you observe anything in me so very faulty as would require from you to others in my behalf the palliation of friendly and partial love, you acquaint me with it: for methinks I would so conduct myself as not to give reason even for an <em>adversary</em> to censure me; and how shall so weak and so young a creature avoid the censure of <em>such</em>, if my <em>friend</em> will not hold a looking-glass before me to let me see my imperfections?</p>
				<p>Judge me, then, my dear, as any indifferent person (knowing what you know of me) would do. I may be at first be a little pained; may <em>glow</em> a little perhaps to be found less worthy of your friendship than I wish to be; but assure yourself, that your kind correction will give me reflection that shall <em>amend</em> me. If it do not, you will have a fault to accuse me of, that will be utterly <em>inexcusable</em>: a fault, let me add, that should you not accuse me of it (if in your opinion I am guilty) you will not be so much, so <em>warmly</em>, my friend as I am yours; since I have never spared <em>you</em> on the like occasions.</p>
				<p>Here I break off to begin another letter to you, with the assurance, meantime, that I am, and ever will be,</p>
