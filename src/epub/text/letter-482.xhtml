				<p>I have no opportunity to write at length, having necessary orders to give on the melancholy occasion. Joel, who got to me by six in the morning, and whom I dispatched instantly back with the letter I had ready from last night, gives me but an indifferent account of the state of your mind. I wonder not at it; but time (and nothing else can) will make it easier to you: if (that is to say) you have compounded with your conscience; else it may be heavier every day than other.</p>
				<hr/>
				<p>Tourville tells us what a way you are in. I hope you will not think of coming hither. The lady in her will desires you may not see her. Four copies are making of it. It is a long one; for she gives her reasons for all she wills. I will write to you more particularly as soon as possibly I can.</p>
				<hr/>
				<p>Three letters are just brought by a servant in livery, directed <em>To Miss Clarissa Harlowe</em>. I will send copies of them to you. The contents are enough to make one mad. How would this poor lady have rejoiced to receive them!⁠—And yet, if she had, she would not have been enabled to say, as she nobly did,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-382" id="noteref-382" epub:type="noteref">382</a> <q>That God would not let her depend for comfort upon any but Himself.</q>⁠—And indeed for some days past she had seemed to have got above all worldly considerations.⁠—Her <em>fervent love, even for her Miss Howe</em>, as she acknowledged, having given way to <q>supremer fervours</q>.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-383" id="noteref-383" epub:type="noteref">383</a></p>
