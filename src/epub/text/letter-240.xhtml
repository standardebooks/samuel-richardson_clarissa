				<p>The lady gave Will’s sweetheart a letter last night to be carried to the post-house, as this morning, directed for Miss Howe, under cover to Hickman. I dare say neither cover nor letter will be seen to have been opened. The contents but eight lines⁠—To own⁠—“The receipt of her double-dated letter in safety; and referring to a longer letter, which she intends to write, when she shall have a quieter heart, and less trembling fingers. But mentions something to have happened (My detecting her she means) which has given her very great flutters, confusions, and apprehensions: but which she will wait the issue of (Some hopes for me hence, Jack!) before she gives her fresh perturbation or concern on her account.⁠—She tells her how impatient she shall be for her next,” <abbr class="eoc">etc.</abbr></p>
				<p>Now, Belford, I thought it would be but kind in me to save Miss Howe’s concern on these alarming hints; since the curiosity of such a spirit must have been prodigiously excited by them. Having therefore so good a copy to imitate, I wrote; and, taking out that of my beloved, put under the same cover the following short billet; inscriptive and conclusive parts of it in her own words.</p>

					<p>A few lines only, till calmer spirits and quieter fingers be granted me, and till I can get over the shock which your intelligence has given me⁠—to acquaint you⁠—that your kind long letter of Wednesday, and, as I may say, of Thursday morning, is come safe to my hands. On receipt of yours by my messenger to you, I sent for it from Wilson’s. There, thank Heaven! it lay. May that Heaven reward you for all your past, and for all your <em>intended</em> goodness to</p>

				<p>I took great pains in writing this. It cannot, I hope, be suspected. Her hand is so <em>very</em> delicate. Yet hers is written less beautifully than she usually writes: and I hope Miss Howe will allow somewhat for <em>hurry of spirits</em>, and <em>unsteady fingers</em>.</p>
				<p>My consideration for Miss Howe’s <em>ease of mind</em> extended still farther than to the instance I have mentioned.</p>
				<p>That this billet might be with her as soon as possible, (and before it could have reached Hickman by the post), I dispatched it away by a servant of Mowbray’s. Miss Howe, had there been any failure or delay, might, as thou wilt think, have communicated her anxieties to her fugitive friend; and she <em>to me</em> perhaps in a way I should not have been pleased with.</p>
				<p>Once more wilt thou wonderingly question⁠—All this pains for a single girl?</p>
				<p>Yes, Jack⁠—But is not this girl a <strong>Clarissa</strong>?⁠—And who knows, but kind fortune, as a reward for my perseverance, may toss me in her charming friend? Less likely things have come to pass, Belford. And to be sure I shall have her, if I resolve upon it.</p>
