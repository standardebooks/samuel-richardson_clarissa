				<p>Just as I had sealed up the enclosed, comes a letter to my beloved, in a cover to me, directed to Lord <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">M.</abbr>’s. From whom, thinkest thou?⁠—From <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mrs.</abbr> Howe!</p>
				<p>And what the contents?</p>
				<p>How should I know, unless the dear creature had communicated them to me? But a very cruel letter I believe it is, <em>by the effect it had upon her</em>. The tears ran down her cheeks as she read it; and her colour changed several times. No end of her persecutions, I think!</p>
				<p>“What a cruelty in my fate!” said the sweet lamenter.⁠—“Now the <em>only</em> comfort of my life must be given up!”</p>
				<p>Miss Howe’s correspondence, no doubt.</p>
				<p>But <em>should</em> she be so much grieved at this? This correspondence was prohibited before, and that, to the <em>daughter</em>, in the strongest terms: but yet carried on by both; although a <em>brace of impeccables</em>, an’t please ye. Could they expect, that a mother would not vindicate her authority?⁠—and finding her prohibition ineffectual with her perverse <em>daughter</em>, was it not reasonable to suppose she would try what effect it would have upon her <em>daughter’s friend</em>?⁠—And now I believe the end will be effectually answered: for my beloved, I dare say, will make a point of conscience of it.</p>
				<p>I hate cruelty, especially in <em>women</em>; and should have been more concerned for this instance of it in <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mrs.</abbr> Howe, had I not had a stronger instance of the same in my beloved to Miss Partington: For how did she know, since she was so much afraid for <em>herself</em>, whom Dorcas might let in to that innocent and <em>less watchful</em> young lady? But nevertheless I must needs own, that I am not very sorry for this prohibition, let it <em>originally</em> come from the <em>Harlowes</em>, or <em>from whom it will</em>; because I make no doubt, that it is owing to Miss Howe, in a great measure, that my beloved is so much upon her guard, and thinks so hardly of me. And who can tell, <q>as characters here are so tender</q>, and <q>some disguises so flimsy</q>, what consequences might follow this undutiful correspondence?⁠—I say, therefore, I am not sorry for it: now will she not have anybody to compare notes with: anybody to alarm her: and I may be saved the guilt and disobligation of inspecting into a correspondence that has long made me uneasy.</p>
				<p>How everything works for me!⁠—Why will this charming creature make <em>such contrivances</em> necessary, as will increase my trouble, and my guilt too, as some will account it? But why, rather I should ask, will she fight against her stars?</p>
