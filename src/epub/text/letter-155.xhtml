				</header>
				<p>At length, my dearest Miss Howe, I am in London, and in my new lodgings. They are neatly furnished, and the situation, for the town, is pleasant.</p>
				<p>But I think you must not ask me how I like the old gentlewoman. Yet she seems courteous and obliging.⁠—Her kinswomen just appeared to welcome me at my alighting. They seemed to be genteel young women. But more of their aunt and them, as I shall see more.</p>
				<p>Miss Sorlings has an uncle at Barnet, whom she found so very ill, that her uneasiness, on that account, (having large expectations from him), made me comply with her desire to stay with him. Yet I wished, as her uncle did not expect her, that she would see me settled in London; and <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Lovelace was still more earnest that she would, offering to send her back again in a day or two, and urging that her uncle’s malady threatened not a sudden change. But leaving the matter to <em>her choice</em>, after she knew what <em>would have been mine</em>, she made me not the expected compliment. <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Lovelace, however, made her a handsome present at parting.</p>
				<p>His genteel spirit, on all occasions, makes me often wish him more consistent.</p>
				<p>As soon as he arrived, I took possession of my apartment. I shall make good use of the light closet in it, if I stay here any time.</p>
				<p>One of his attendants returns in the morning to The Lawn; and I made writing to you by him an excuse for my retiring.</p>
				<p>And now give me leave to chide you, my dearest friend, for your rash, and I hope revocable resolution not to make <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Hickman the happiest man in the world, while my happiness is in suspense. Suppose I were to be unhappy, what, my dear, would this resolution of yours avail me? Marriage is the highest state of friendship: if happy, it lessens our cares, by dividing them, at the same time that it doubles our pleasures by a mutual participation. Why, my dear, if you love me, will you not rather give <em>another</em> friend to one who has <em>not two</em> she is sure of? Had you married on your mother’s last birthday, as she would have had you, I should not, I dare say, have wanted a refuge; that would have saved me many mortifications, and much disgrace.</p>
				<hr/>
				<p>Here I was broke in upon by <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Lovelace; introducing the widow leading in a kinswoman of hers to attend me, if I approved of her, till my Hannah should come, or till I had provided myself with some other servant. The widow gave her many good qualities; but said, that she had one great defect; which was, that she could not write, nor read writing; that part of her education having been neglected when she was young; but for discretion, fidelity, obligingness, she was not to be outdone by anybody. So commented her likewise for her skill at the needle.</p>
				<p>As for <em>her defect</em>, I can easily forgive that. She is very likely and genteel⁠—too genteel indeed, I think, for a servant. But what I like least of all in her, she has a strange sly eye. I never saw such an eye; half-confident, I think. But indeed <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mrs.</abbr> Sinclair herself, (for that is the widow’s name), has an odd winking eye; and her respectfulness seems too much studied, methinks, for the London ease and freedom. But people can’t help their looks, you know; and after all she is extremely civil and obliging⁠—and as for the young woman, (Dorcas is her name), she will not be long with me.</p>
				<p>I accepted her: How could I do otherwise, (if I had had a mind to make objections, which, in my present situation, I had not), her aunt present, and the young woman also present; and <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Lovelace officious in his introducing them, to oblige me? But, upon their leaving me, I told <em>him</em>, (who seemed inclinable to begin a conversation with me), that I desired that this apartment might be considered as my retirement: that when I saw him it might be in the dining-room, (which is up a few stairs; for this back-house, being once two, the rooms do not all of them very conveniently communicate with each other), and that I might be as little broken in upon as possible, when I am here. He withdrew very respectfully to the door, but there stopped; and asked for my company <em>then</em> in the dining-room. If he were about setting out for other lodgings, I would go with him now, I told him; but, if he did not just then go, I would first finish my letter to Miss Howe.</p>
				<p>I see he has no mind to leave me if he can help it. My brother’s scheme may give him a pretence to try to engage me to dispense with his promise. But if I <em>now do</em> I must acquit him of it entirely.</p>
				<p>My approbation of his tender behaviour in the midst of my grief, has given him a right, as he seems to think, of addressing me with all the freedom of an approved lover. I see by this man, that when once a woman embarks with this sex, there is no receding. One concession is but the prelude to another with them. He has been ever since Sunday last continually complaining of the distance I keep him at; and thinks himself entitled now to call in question my value for him; strengthening his doubts by my former declared readiness to give him up to a reconciliation with my friends; and yet has himself fallen off from that <em>obsequious tenderness</em>, if I may couple the words, which drew from me the concessions he builds upon.</p>
				<p>While we were talking at the door, my new servant came up with an invitation to us both to tea. I said <em>he</em> might accept of it, if he pleased: but I must pursue my writing; and not choosing either tea or supper, I desired him to make my excuses below, as to both; and inform them of my choice to be retired as much as possible; yet to promise for me my attendance on the widow and her nieces at breakfast in the morning.</p>
				<p>He objected particularly in the eye of strangers as to avoiding supper.</p>
				<p>You know, said I, and you can tell them, that I seldom eat suppers. My spirits are low. You must never urge me against a declared choice. Pray, <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Lovelace, inform them of all my particularities. If they are obliging, they will allow for them⁠—I come not hither to make new acquaintance.</p>
				<p>I have turned over the books I found in my closet; and am not a little pleased with them; and think the better of the people of the house for their sakes.</p>
				<p>Stanhope’s <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Gospels</i>; Sharp’s, Tillotson’s, and South’s <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Sermons</i>; Nelson’s <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Feasts and Fasts</i>; a <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Sacramental Piece of the Bishop of Man</i>, and another of <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Dr.</abbr> Gauden, Bishop of Exeter; and Inett’s <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Devotions</i>, are among the devout books:⁠—and among those of a lighter turn, the following not ill-chosen ones: A <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Telemachus</i>, in French; another in English; Steel’s, Rowe’s, and Shakespeare’s <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Plays</i>; that genteel Comedy of <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Cibber, <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">The Careless Husband</i>, and others of the same author; Dryden’s Miscellanies; the <i epub:type="se:name.publication.journal">Tatlers</i>, <i epub:type="se:name.publication.journal">Spectators</i>, and <i epub:type="se:name.publication.journal">Guardians</i>; Pope’s, and Swift’s, and Addison’s <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Works</i>.</p>
				<p>In the blank leaves of the Nelson and Bishop Gauden, is <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mrs.</abbr> Sinclair’s name; and in those of most of the others, either Sarah Martin, or Mary Horton, the names of the two nieces.</p>
				<hr/>
				<p>I am exceedingly out of humour with <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Lovelace: and have great reason to be so, as you will allow, when you have read the conversation I am going to give you an account of; for he would not let me rest till I gave him my company in the dining-room.</p>
				<p>He began with letting me know, that he had been out to inquire after the character of the widow, which was the more necessary, he said, as he supposed that I would <q>expect his frequent absence</q>.</p>
				<p>I <em>did</em>, I said; and that he would not think of taking up his lodging in the same house with me. But what, said I, is the result of your inquiry?</p>
				<p>Why, indeed, the widow’s character was, in the main, what he liked well enough. But as it was Miss Howe’s opinion, as I had told him, that my brother had not given over his scheme; as the widow lived by letting lodgings, and had others to let in the same part of the house, which might be taken by an enemy; he knew no better way than for him to take them all, as it could not be for a long time, <q>unless I would think of removing to others</q>.</p>
				<p>So far was well enough. But as it was easy for me to see, that he spoke the slighter of the widow, in order to have a pretence to lodge here himself, I asked him his intention in that respect. And he frankly owned, that if I chose to stay here, he could not, as matters stood, think of leaving me for six hours together; and he had prepared the widow to expect, that we should be here but for a few days; only till we could fix ourselves in a house suitable to our condition; and this, that I might be under the less embarrassment, if I pleased to remove.</p>
				<p>Fix <em>our</em>-selves in a house, and <em>we</em>, and <em>our</em>, <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Lovelace⁠—Pray, in what light⁠—</p>
				<p>He interrupted me⁠—Why, my dearest life, if you will hear me with patience⁠—yet, I am half afraid that I have been too forward, as I have not consulted you upon it⁠—but as my friends in town, according to what <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Doleman has written, in the letter you have seen, conclude us to be married⁠—</p>
				<p>Surely, Sir, you have not presumed⁠—</p>
				<p>Hear me out, my dearest creature⁠—you have received with favour, my addresses: you have made me hope for the honour of your consenting hand: yet, by declining my most fervent tender of myself to you at <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mrs.</abbr> Sorlings’s, have given me apprehensions of delay: I would not for the world be thought so ungenerous a wretch, now you have honoured me with your confidence, <q>as to wish to precipitate you</q>. Yet your brother’s schemes are not given up. Singleton, I am afraid, is actually in town; his vessel lies at Rotherhithe⁠—your brother is absent from Harlowe-place; indeed not with Singleton yet, as I can hear. If you are <em>known</em> to be mine, or if you are but <em>thought</em> to be so, there will probably be an end of your brother’s contrivances. The widow’s character may be as worthy <q>as it is said to be</q>. But the worthier she is, the more danger, if your brother’s agent should find us out; since she may be persuaded, that she ought in conscience to take a parent’s part against a child who stands in opposition to them. But if she believes us married, her good character will stand us instead, and give her a reason why two apartments are requisite for us at the hour of retirement.</p>
				<p>I perfectly raved at him. I would have flung from him in resentment; but he would not let me: and what could I do? Whither go, the evening advanced?</p>
				<p>I am astonished at you! said I.⁠—If you are a man of honour, what need of all this strange obliquity? You delight in crooked ways⁠—let me know, since I <em>must</em> stay in your company (for he held my hand), let me know all you have said to the people below.⁠—Indeed, indeed, <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Lovelace, you are a very unaccountable man.</p>
				<p>My dearest creature, need I to have mentioned anything of this? and could I not have taken up my lodgings in this house unknown to you, if I had not intended to make you the judge of all my proceedings?⁠—But <em>this</em> is what I have told the widow before her kinswomen, and before your new servant⁠—“That indeed we were privately married at Hertford; but that you had preliminarily bound me under a solemn vow, which I am most religiously resolved to keep, to be contented with separate apartments, and even not to lodge under the same roof, till a certain reconciliation shall take place, which is of high consequence to both.” And further that I might convince you of the purity of my intentions, and that my whole view in this was to prevent mischief, I have acquainted them, “that I have solemnly promised to behave to you before everybody, as if we were only betrothed, and not married; not even offering to take any of those innocent freedoms which are not refused in the most punctilious loves.”</p>
				<p>And then he solemnly vowed to me the strictest observance of the same respectful behaviour to me.</p>
				<p>I said, that I was not by any means satisfied with the tale he had told, nor with the necessity he wanted to lay me under of appearing what I was not: that every step he took was a wry one, a needless wry one: and since he thought it necessary to tell the people below anything about me, I insisted that he should unsay all he had said, and tell them the truth.</p>
				<p>What he had told them, he said, was with so many circumstances, that he could sooner die than contradict it. And still he insisted upon the propriety of appearing to be married, for the reasons he had given before⁠—And, dearest creature, said he, why this high displeasure with me upon so well-intended an expedient? You know, that I cannot wish to shun your brother, or his Singleton, but upon your account. The first step I would take, if left to myself, would be to find them out. <em>I have always acted in this manner, when anybody has presumed to give out threatenings against it.</em></p>
				<p>’Tis true I would have consulted you first, and had your leave. But since you dislike what I have said, let me implore you, dearest Madam, to give the only proper sanction to it, by naming an early day. Would to Heaven that were to be tomorrow!⁠—For God’s sake, let it be tomorrow! But, if not, (was it his business, my dear, before I spoke (yet he seemed to be afraid of me) to say, <em>if not</em>)? let me beseech you, Madam, if my behaviour shall not be to your dislike, that you will not tomorrow, at breakfast-time, discredit what I have told them. The moment I give you cause to think that I take any advantage of your concession, that moment revoke it, and expose me, as I shall deserve.⁠—And once more, let me remind you, that I have no view either to serve or save myself by this expedient. It is only to prevent a probable mischief, for your own mind’s sake; and for the sake of those who deserve not the least consideration from me.</p>
				<p>What could I say? What could I do?⁠—I verily think, that had he urged me again, in a <em>proper manner</em>, I should have consented (little satisfied as I am with him) to give him a meeting tomorrow morning at a more solemn place than in the parlour below.</p>
				<p>But this I resolve, that he shall not have my consent to stay a night under this roof. He has now given me a stronger reason for this determination than I had before.</p>
				<hr/>
				<p>Alas! my dear, how vain a thing to say, what we will, or what we will not do, when we have put ourselves into the power of this sex!⁠—He went down to the people below, on my desiring to be left to myself; and stayed till their supper was just ready; and then, desiring a moment’s <em>audience</em>, as he called it, he besought my leave to stay that one night, promising to set out either for Lord <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">M.</abbr>’s, or for Edgeware, to his friend Belford’s, in the morning, after breakfast. But if I were against it, he said, he would not stay supper; and would attend me about eight next day⁠—yet he added, that my denial would have a very particular appearance to the people below, from what he had told them; and the more, as he had actually agreed for all the vacant apartments, (indeed only for a month), for the reasons he before hinted at: but I need not stay here two days, if, upon conversing with the widow and her nieces in the morning, I should have any dislike to them.</p>
				<p>I thought, notwithstanding my resolution above-mentioned, that it would seem too punctilious to deny him, under the circumstances he had mentioned: having, besides, no reason to think he would obey me; for he looked as if he were determined to debate the matter with me. And now, as I see no likelihood of a reconciliation with my friends, and as I have actually received his addresses, I thought I would not quarrel with him, if I could help it, especially as he asked to stay but for one night, and could have done so without my knowing it; and you being of opinion, that the proud wretch, distrusting his own merits with me, or at least my regard for him, will probably bring me to some concessions in his favour⁠—for all these reasons, I thought proper to yield <em>this</em> point: yet I was so vexed with him on the <em>other</em>, that it was impossible for me to comply with that grace which a concession should be made with, or not made at all.</p>
				<p>This was what I said⁠—What you <em>will</em> do, you <em>must</em> do, I think. You are very ready to promise; very ready to depart from your promise. You say, however, that you will set out tomorrow for the country. You know how ill I have been. I am not well enough now to debate with you upon your encroaching ways. I am utterly dissatisfied with the tale you have told below. Nor will I promise to appear to the people of the house tomorrow what I am not.</p>
				<p>He withdrew in the most respectful manner, beseeching me only to favour him with such a meeting in the morning as might not make the widow and her nieces think he had given me reason to be offended with him.</p>
				<p>I retired to my own apartment, and Dorcas came to me soon after to take my commands. I told her, that I required very little attendance, and always dressed and undressed myself.</p>
				<p>She seemed concerned, as if she thought I had repulsed her; and said, it should be her whole study to oblige me.</p>
				<p>I told her, that I was not difficult to be pleased: and should let her know from time to time what assistance I should expect from her. But for that night I had no occasion for her further attendance.</p>
				<p>She is not only genteel, but is well bred, and well spoken⁠—she must have had what is generally thought to be the polite part of education: but it is strange, that fathers and mothers should make so light, as they generally do, of that preferable part, in girls, which would improve their minds, and give a grace to all the rest.</p>
				<p>As soon as she was gone, I inspected the doors, the windows, the wainscot, the dark closet as well as the light one; and finding very good fastenings to the door, and to all the windows, I again had recourse to my pen.</p>
				<hr/>
				<p><abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mrs.</abbr> Sinclair is just now gone from me. Dorcas, she told me, had acquainted her, that I had dismissed her for the night. She came to ask me how I liked my apartment, and to wish me good rest. She expressed her concern, that they could not have my company at supper. <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Lovelace, she said, had informed them of my love of retirement. She assured me, that I should not be broken in upon. She highly extolled <em>him</em>, and gave <em>me</em> a share in the praise as to person. But was sorry, she said, that she was likely to lose us so soon as <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Lovelace talked of.</p>
				<p>I answered her with suitable civility; and she withdrew with great tokens of respect. With greater, I think, than should be from distance of years, as she was the wife of a gentleman; and as the appearance of everything about her, as well house as dress, carries the marks of such good circumstances, as require not abasement.</p>
				<p>If, my dear, you <em>will</em> write, against prohibition, be pleased to direct, <em>To Miss Laetitia Beaumont; to be left till called for, at <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Wilson’s, in Pall Mall</em>.</p>
				<p><abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Lovelace proposed this direction to me, not <em>knowing</em> of your desire that your letters should pass by a third hand. As his motive for it was, that my brother might not trace out where we are, I am glad, as well from this instance as from others, that he seems to think he has done mischief enough already.</p>
				<p>Do you know how my poor Hannah does?</p>
				<p><abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Lovelace is so full of his contrivances and expedients, that I think it may not be amiss to desire you to look carefully to the seals of my letters, as I shall to those of yours. If I find him base in this particular, I shall think him capable of any evil; and will fly him as my worst enemy.</p>
