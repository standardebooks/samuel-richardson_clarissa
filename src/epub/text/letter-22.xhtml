				</header>
				<p>Hannah has just brought me from the private place in the garden-wall, a letter from <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Lovelace, deposited last night, signed also by Lord <abbr class="eoc" epub:type="z3998:personal-name">M.</abbr></p>
				<p>He tells me in it, “That <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Solmes makes it his boast, that he is to be married in a few days to one of the shyest women in England: that my brother explains his meaning: This shy creature, he says, is me; and he assures everyone, that his younger sister is very soon to be <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Solmes’s wife. He tells me of the patterns bespoken which my mother mentioned to me.”</p>
				<p>Not one thing escapes him that is done or said in this house.</p>
				<p>“My sister, he says, reports the same things; and that with such particular aggravations of insult upon <em>him</em>, that he cannot but be extremely piqued, as well at the manner, as from the occasion; and expresses himself with great violence upon it.</p>
				<p>“He knows not, he says, what my relations’ inducements can be to prefer such a man as Solmes to him. If advantageous settlements be the motive, Solmes shall not offer what he will refuse to comply with.</p>
				<p>“As to his estate and family; the first cannot be excepted against: and for the second, he will not disgrace himself by a comparison so odious. He appeals to Lord <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">M.</abbr> for the regularity of his life and manners ever since he has made his addresses to me, or had hope of my favour.”</p>
				<p>I suppose he would have his Lordship’s signing to this letter to be taken as a voucher for him.</p>
				<p>“He desires my leave (in company with my Lord), in a pacific manner, to attend my father and uncles, in order to make proposals that <em>must</em> be accepted, if they will see him, and hear what they are: and tells me, that he will submit to any measures that I shall prescribe, in order to bring about a reconciliation.”</p>
				<p>He presumes to be very earnest with me, “to give him a private meeting some night, in my father’s garden, attended by whom I please.”</p>
				<p>Really, my dear, were you to see his letter, you would think I had given him great encouragement, and that I am in direct treaty with him; or that he is sure that my friends will drive me into a foreign protection; for he has the boldness to offer, in my Lord’s name, an asylum to me, should I be tyrannically treated in Solmes’s behalf.</p>
				<p>I suppose it is the way of this sex to endeavour to entangle the thoughtless of ours by bold supposals and offers, in hopes that we shall be too complaisant or bashful to quarrel with them; and, if not checked, to reckon upon our silence, as assents voluntarily given, or concessions made in their favour.</p>
				<p>There are other particulars in this letter which I ought to mention to you: but I will take an opportunity to send you the letter itself, or a copy of it.</p>
				<p>For my own part, I am very uneasy to think how I have been <em>drawn</em> on one hand, and <em>driven</em> on the other, into a clandestine, in short, into a mere loverlike correspondence, which my heart condemns.</p>
				<p>It is easy to see, if I do not break it off, that <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Lovelace’s advantages, by reason of my unhappy situation, will every day increase, and I shall be more and more entangled. Yet if I do put an end to it, without making it a condition of being freed from <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Solmes’s address⁠—May I, my dear, is it <em>best</em> to continue it a little longer, in order to extricate myself out of the other difficulty, by giving up all thoughts of <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Lovelace?⁠—<em>Whose</em> advice can I now ask but yours?</p>
				<p>All my relations are met. They are at breakfast together. <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Solmes is expected. I am excessively uneasy. I must lay down my pen.</p>
				<hr/>
				<p>They are all going to church together. Grievously disordered they appear to be, as Hannah tells me. She believes something is resolved upon.</p>
				<hr/>
				<p epub:type="se:letter.dateline">Sunday Noon.</p>
				<p>What a cruel thing is suspense!⁠—I will ask leave to go to church this afternoon. I expect to be denied. But, if I do not ask, they may allege, that my not going is owing to myself.</p>
				<hr/>
				<p>I desired to speak with Shorey. Shorey came. I directed her to carry to my mother my request for permission to go to church this afternoon. What think you was the return? Tell her, that she must direct herself to her brother for any favour she has to ask.⁠—So, my dear, I am to be delivered up to my brother!</p>
				<p>I was resolved, however, to ask of <em>him</em> this favour. Accordingly, when they sent me up my solitary dinner, I gave the messenger a billet, in which I made it my humble request through him to my father, to be permitted to go to church this afternoon.</p>
				<p>This was the contemptuous answer: “Tell her, that her request will be taken into consideration <em>tomorrow</em>.” My request to go to church <em>today</em> to be taken into consideration <em>tomorrow</em>!</p>
				<p>Patience will be the fittest return I can make to such an insult. But this method will not do with me; indeed it will not! And yet it is but the beginning, I suppose, of what I am to expect from my brother, now I am delivered up to him.</p>
				<p>On recollection, I thought it best to renew my request. I did. The following is a copy of what I wrote, and what follows that, of the answer sent me.</p>

					<p>I know not what to make of the answer brought to my request of being permitted to go to church this afternoon. If you designed to show your pleasantry by it, I hope that will continue; and then my request will be granted.</p>
					<p>You know, that I never absented myself, when well, and at home, till the two last Sundays; when I was <em>advised</em> not to go. My present situation is such, that I never more wanted the benefit of the public prayers.</p>
					<p>I will solemnly engage only to go thither, and back again.</p>
					<p>I hope it cannot be thought that I would do otherwise.</p>
					<p>My dejection of spirits will give a too just excuse on the score of indisposition for avoiding visits. Nor will I, but by distant civilities, return the compliments of any of my acquaintances. My disgraces, if they are to have an end, need not be proclaimed to the whole world. I ask this favour, therefore, for my reputation’s sake, that I may be able to hold up my head in the neighbourhood, if I live to see an end of the unmerited severities which seem to be designed for</p>

					<p>For a girl to lay so much stress upon going to church, and yet resolve to defy her parents, in an article of the greatest consequence to them, and to the whole family, is an absurdity. You are recommended, Miss, to the practice of your <em>private</em> devotions. May <em>they</em> be efficacious upon the mind of one of the most pervicacious young creatures that ever was heard of! The <em>intention</em> is, I tell you plainly, to mortify you into a sense of your duty. The neighbours you are so solicitous to appear well with, already know, that you defy <em>that</em>. So, Miss, if you have a real value for your reputation, show it as you ought. It is yet in your own power to establish or impair it.</p>

				<p>Thus, my dear Miss Howe, has my brother got me into his snares; and I, like a poor silly bird, the more I struggle, am the more entangled.</p>
