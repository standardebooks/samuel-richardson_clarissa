				</header>
				<p>I received thy letter in such good time, by thy fellow’s dispatch, that it gives me an opportunity of throwing in a few paragraphs upon it. I read a passage or two of it to Mowbray; and we both agree that thou art an absolute master of the lamentable.</p>
				<p>Poor Belton! what terrible conflicts were thy last conflicts!⁠—I hope, however, that he is happy: and I have the more hope, because the hardness of his death is likely to be such a warning to <em>thee</em>. If it have the effect thou declarest it shall have, what a world of mischief will it prevent! how much good will it do! how many poor wretches will rejoice at the <em>occasion</em>, (if they know it), however melancholy in itself, which shall bring them in a compensation for injuries they had been forced to sit down contented with! But, Jack, though thy uncle’s death has made thee a rich fellow, art thou sure that the making good of such a vow will not totally bankrupt thee?</p>
				<p>Thou sayest I may laugh at thee, if I will. Not I, Jack: I do not take it to be a laughing subject: and I am heartily concerned at the loss we all have in poor Belton: and when I get a little settled, and have leisure to contemplate the vanity of all sublunary things (a subject that will now-and-then, in my gayest hours, obtrude itself upon me) it is very likely that I may talk seriously with thee upon these topics; and, if thou hast not got too much the start of me in the repentance thou art entering upon, will go hand-in-hand with thee in it. If thou hast, thou wilt let me just keep thee in my eye; for it is an uphill work; and I shall see thee, at setting out, at a great distance; but as thou art a much heavier and clumsier fellow than myself, I hope that without much puffing and sweating, only keeping on a good round dogtrot, I shall be able to overtake thee.</p>
				<p>Meantime, take back thy letter, as thou desirest. I would not have it in my pocket upon any account at present; nor read it once more.</p>
				<p>I am going down without seeing my beloved. I was a hasty fool to write her a letter, promising that I would not come near her till I saw her at her father’s. For as she is now actually at Smith’s, and I so near her, one short visit could have done no harm.</p>
				<p>I sent Will, two hours ago, with my grateful compliments, and to know how she does.</p>
				<p>How must I adore this charming creature! for I am ready to think my servant a happier fellow than myself, for having been within a pair of stairs and an apartment of her.</p>
				<p>Mowbray and I will drop a tear apiece, as we ride along, to the memory of poor Belton:⁠—<em>as we ride along</em>, said I: for we shall have so much joy when we arrive at Lord <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">M.</abbr>’s, and when I communicate to him and my cousins the dear creature’s letter, that we shall forget everything grievous: since now their family-hopes in my reformation (the point which lies so near their hearts) will all revive; it being an article of their faith, that if I marry, repentance and mortification will follow of course.</p>
				<p>Neither Mowbray nor I shall accept of thy <em>verbal</em> invitation to the funeral. We like not these dismal formalities. And as to the respect that is supposed to be shown to the memory of a deceased friend in such an attendance, why should we do anything to reflect upon those who have made it a fashion to leave this parade to people whom they <em>hire for that purpose</em>?</p>
				<p>Adieu, and be cheerful. Thou canst now do no more for poor Belton, wert thou to howl for him to the end of thy life.</p>
