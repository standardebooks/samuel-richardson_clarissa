				<p>I stayed at Smith’s till I saw the last of all that is mortal of the divine lady.</p>
				<p>As she has directed rings by her will to several persons, with her hair to be set in crystal, the afflicted <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mrs.</abbr> Norton cut off, before the coffin was closed four charming ringlets; one of which the Colonel took for a locket, which, he says, he will cause to be made, and wear next his heart in memory of his beloved cousin.</p>
				<p>Between four and five in the morning, the corpse was put into the hearse; the coffin before being filled, as intended, with flowers and aromatic herbs, and proper care taken to prevent the corpse suffering (to the eye) from the jolting of the hearse.</p>
				<p>Poor <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mrs.</abbr> Norton is extremely ill. I gave particular directions to <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mrs.</abbr> Smith’s maid (whom I have ordered to attend the good woman in a mourning chariot) to take care of her. The Colonel, who rides with his servants within view of the hearse, says that he will see my orders in relation to her enforced.</p>
				<p>When the hearse moved off, and was out of sight, I locked up the lady’s chamber, into which all that had belonged to her was removed.</p>
				<p>I expect to hear from the Colonel as soon as he is got down, by a servant of his own.</p>
