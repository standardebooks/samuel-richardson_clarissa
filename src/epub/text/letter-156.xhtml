				<p>I have yours; just brought me. <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Hickman has helped me to a lucky expedient, which, with the assistance of the post, will enable me to correspond with you every day. An honest higler, (Simon Collins his name), by whom I shall send this, and the two enclosed, (now I have your direction whither), goes to town constantly on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays; and can bring back to me from <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Wilson’s what you shall have caused to be left for me.</p>
				<p>I congratulate you on your arrival in town, so much amended in spirits. I must be brief. I hope you’ll have no cause to repent returning my Norris. It is forthcoming on demand.</p>
				<p>I am sorry your Hannah can’t be with you. She is very ill still; but not dangerously.</p>
				<p>I long for your account of the women you are with. If they are not right people, you will find them out in one breakfasting.</p>

				<p>Depend upon it, my dear, he will not leave you, either night or day, if he can help it, now he has got footing.</p>
				<p>I should have abhorred him for his report of your marriage, had he not made it with such circumstances as leave it still in your power to keep him at distance. If once he offer at the <em>least</em> familiarity⁠—but this is needless to say to you. He can have, I think, no other design but what he professes; because he must needs think, that his report of being married to you must increase your vigilance.</p>
				<p>You may depend upon my looking narrowly into the sealings of your letters. If, as you say, he be base in that point, he will be so in everything. But to a person of your merit, of your fortune, of your virtue, he cannot be base. The man is no fool. It is his interest, as well with regard to his expectations from his own friends, as from you, to be honest. Would to Heaven, however, you were <em>really</em> married!
