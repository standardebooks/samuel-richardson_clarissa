				<p>I always loved writing, and my unhappy situation gives me now enough of it; and you, I fear, too much. I have had another very warm debate with <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Lovelace. It brought on the subject which you advised me not to decline, when it was handsomely offered. And I want to have either your acquittal or blame for having suffered it to go off without effect.</p>
				<p>The impatient wretch sent up to me several times, while I was writing my last to you, to desire my company: yet his business nothing particular; only to hear <em>him</em> talk. The man seems pleased with his own volubility; and, whenever he has collected together abundance of smooth things, he wants me to find an ear for them! Yet he need not; for I don’t often gratify him either with giving him the praise for his verboseness, or showing the pleasure in it that he would be fond of.</p>
				<p>When I had finished the letter, and given it to <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Hickman’s friend, I was going up again, and had got up half a dozen stairs; when he besought me to stop, and hear what he had to say.</p>
				<p>Nothing, as I said, to any new purpose had he to offer; but complainings; and those in a manner, and with an air, as I thought, that bordered upon insolence. He could not live, he told me, unless he had more of my company, and of my <em>indulgence</em> too, that I had yet given him.</p>
				<p>Hereupon I stepped down, and into the parlour, not a little out of humour with him; and the more, as he has very <em>quietly taken up his quarters here</em>, without talking of removing, as he had promised.</p>
				<p>We began instantly our angry conference. He provoked me; and I repeated several of the plainest things I had said in our former conversations; and particularly told him, that I was every hour more and more dissatisfied with myself, and with him: that he was not a man, who, in my opinion, improved upon acquaintance: and that I should not be <q>easy till he had left me to myself</q>.</p>
				<p>He might be surprised at my warmth, perhaps: but really the man looked so like a simpleton, hesitating, and having nothing to say for himself, or that should excuse the peremptoriness of his demand upon me, (when he knew I had been writing a letter which a gentleman waited for), that I flung from him, declaring, that I would be mistress of my own time, and of my own actions, and not to be called to account for either.</p>
				<p>He was very uneasy till he could again be admitted into my company, and when I was obliged to see him, which was sooner than I liked, never did the man put on a more humble and respectful demeanor.</p>
				<p>He told me, that he had, upon this occasion, been entering into himself, and had found a great deal of reason to blame himself for an impertinency and inconsideration which, although he meant nothing by it, must be very disagreeable to one of my delicacy. That having always aimed at a <q>manly sincerity</q> and <q>openness of heart</q>, he had not till now discovered, that both were very consistent with that <em>true</em> politeness, which he feared he had too much disregarded, while he sought to avoid the contrary extreme; knowing, that in me he had to deal with a lady, who despised an hypocrite, and who was above all flattery. But from this time forth, I should find such an alteration in his whole behaviour, as might be expected from a man who knew himself to be honoured with the presence and conversation of a person, <q>who had the most delicate mind in the world</q>⁠—that was his flourish.</p>
				<p>I said, that he might perhaps expect congratulation upon the discovery he had just now made, to wit, that <em>true politeness</em> and <em>sincerity</em> were reconcilable: but that I, who had, by a perverse fate, been thrown into his company, had abundant reason to regret that he had not sooner found this out.⁠—Since, I believed, very few men of <em>birth</em> and <em>education</em> were strangers to it.</p>
				<p>He knew not, <em>neither</em>, he said, that he had so badly behaved himself, as to deserve so very severe a rebuke.</p>
				<p>Perhaps not, I replied: but he might, if so, make another discovery from what I had said; which might be to <em>my own</em> disadvantage: since, if he had so much reason to be satisfied with <em>himself</em>, he would see what an ungenerous person he spoke to, who, when he seemed to give himself airs of humility, which, perhaps he thought beneath him to assume, had not the civility to make him a compliment upon them; but was ready to take him at his word.</p>
				<p>He had long, with infinite pleasure, the pretended <q>flattery-hater</q> said, admired my <em>superior</em> talents, and a wisdom in so young a lady, perfectly suprising.</p>
				<p>Let me, Madam, said he, stand ever so low in your opinion, I shall believe all you say to be just; and that I have nothing to do but to govern myself for the future by your example, and by the standard you shall be pleased to give me.</p>
				<p>I know better, Sir, replied I, than to value myself upon your volubility of speech. As you pretend to pay so preferable a regard to sincerity, you shall confine yourself to the strict rules of truth, when you speak of me, to myself: and then, although you shall be so kind as to imagine that you have <em>reason</em> to make me a compliment, you will have much more to pride yourself in those arts which have made so <em>extraordinary</em> a young creature so great a fool.</p>
				<p>Really, my dear, the man deserves not politer treatment.⁠—And then has he not made a fool, an egregious fool of me?⁠—I am afraid he himself thinks he has.</p>
				<p>I am surprised! I am amazed, Madam, returned he, at so strange a turn upon me!⁠—I am very unhappy, that nothing I can do or say will give you a good opinion of me!⁠—Would to heaven that I knew what I <em>can</em> do to obtain the honour of your confidence!</p>
				<p>I told him, <q>that I desired his absence</q>, of all things. I saw not, I said, that my friends thought it worth their while to give me disturbance: therefore, if he would set out for London, or Berkshire, or whither he pleased, it would be most agreeable to me, and most reputable too.</p>
				<p>He would do so, he said, he <q>intended to do so</q>, the moment I was in a place to my liking⁠—in a place convenient for me.</p>
				<p><em>This</em>, Sir, will be so, said I, when you are not here to break in upon me, and make the apartments inconvenient.</p>
				<p>He did not think this place safe, he replied; and as I intended not to stay here, he had not been so solicitous, as otherwise he should have been, to enjoin privacy to his servants, nor to <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mrs.</abbr> Greme at her leaving me; that there were two or three gentlemen at the neighbourhood, he said, with whose servants his gossiping fellows had scraped acquaintance: so that he could not think of leaving me here unguarded and unattended.⁠—But fix upon any place in England where I could be out of danger, and he would go to the furthermost part of the king’s dominions, if by doing so he could make me easy.</p>
				<p>I told him plainly that I should never be in humour with myself for <em>meeting him</em>; nor with him, for <em>seducing me away</em>: that my regrets increased, instead of diminished: that my reputation was wounded: that nothing I could do would now retrieve it: and that he must not wonder, if I every hour grew more and more uneasy both with myself and him: that upon the whole, I was willing to take care of myself; and when <em>he</em> had left me, I should best know what to resolve upon, and whither to go.</p>
				<p>He wished, he said, he were at liberty, without giving me offence, or being thought to intend to <q>infringe the articles I had stipulated and insisted upon</q>, to make one humble proposal to me. But the <q>sacred regard</q> he was determined <q>to pay to all my injunctions</q> (reluctantly as I had on Monday last put it into his power to serve me) would not permit him to make it, unless I would promise to excuse him, if I did not approve of it.</p>
				<p>I asked, in some confusion, what he would say?</p>
				<p>He prefaced and paraded on; and then out came, with great diffidence, and many apologies, and a bashfulness which sat very awkwardly upon him, a proposal of speedy solemnization: which, he said, would put all right; and make my first three or four months (which otherwise must be passed in obscurity and apprehension) a round of visits and visitings to and from all his relations; to Miss Howe; to whom I pleased: and would pave the way to the reconciliation I had so much at heart.</p>
				<p><em>Your advice</em> had great weight with me just then, as well as <em>his reasons</em>, and the consideration of my <em>unhappy situation</em>: But what could I say? I wanted somebody to speak for me.</p>
				<p>The man saw I was not angry at his motion. I only blushed; and that I am sure I did up to the ears; and looked silly, and like a fool.</p>
				<p>He wants not courage. Would he have had me catch at his first, at his <em>very</em> first word?⁠—I was <em>silent</em> too⁠—and do not the bold sex take silence for a mark of a favour!⁠—Then, <em>so lately</em> in my father’s house! Having also declared to him in my letters, before I had your advice, that I would not think of marriage till he had passed through a state of probation, as I may call it⁠—How was it possible I could encourage, with very ready signs of approbation, such an early proposal? especially so soon after the free treatment he had provoked from me. If I were to die, I could not.</p>
				<p>He looked at me with great confidence; as if (notwithstanding his contradictory bashfulness) he would look me through; while my eye but now-and-then could glance at him.⁠—He begged my pardon with great humility: he was <em>afraid</em> I would think he deserved no other answer, but that of a <q>contemptuous silence</q>. True love was fearful of offending. (Take care, <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Lovelace, thought I, how yours is tried by that rule). Indeed so <q>sacred a regard</q> (foolish man!) would he have <q>to all my declarations made before I honoured him</q>⁠—</p>
				<p>I would hear him no further; but withdrew in a confusion <em>too visible</em>, and left him to make his nonsensical flourishes to himself.</p>
				<p>I will only add, that, if he really wishes for a speedy solemnization, he never could have had a luckier time to press for my consent to it. But he let it go off; and indignation has taken place of it. And now it shall be a point with me, to get him at a distance from me.</p>
				<p>I am, my dearest friend,</p>
