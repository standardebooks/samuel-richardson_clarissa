				</header>
				<p>I have yours of this morning. All that has happened to the unhappy body you mentioned, is what we foretold and expected. Let <em>him</em>, for whose sake she abandoned us, be her comfort. We are told he has remorse, and would marry her. We don’t believe it, indeed. She may be very ill. Her disappointment may make her so, or ought. Yet is she the only one I know who is disappointed.</p>
				<p>I cannot say, Miss, that the notification from you is the <em>more</em> welcome, for the liberties you have been pleased to take with our whole family for resenting a conduct, that it is a shame any young lady should justify. Excuse this freedom, occasioned by greater. I am, Miss,</p>
