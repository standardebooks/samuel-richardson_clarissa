				</header>
				<p>I have yours of this morning. All that has happened to the unhappy body you mentioned, is what we foretold and expected. Let <em>him</em>, for whose sake she abandoned us, be her comfort. We are told he has remorse, and would marry her. We donâ€™t believe it, indeed. She may be very ill. Her disappointment may make her so, or ought. Yet is she the only one I know who is disappointed.</p>
				<p>I cannot say, Miss, that the notification from you is the <em>more</em> welcome, for the liberties you have been pleased to take with our whole family for resenting a conduct, that it is a shame any young lady should justify. Excuse this freedom, occasioned by greater. I am, Miss,</p>
