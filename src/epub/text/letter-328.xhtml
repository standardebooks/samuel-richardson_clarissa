				</header>
				<p>Why should you permit a mind, so much devoted to your service, to labour under such an impatience as you must know it <em>would</em> labour under, for want of an answer to a letter of such consequence to <em>you</em>, and therefore to <em>me</em>, as was mine of Thursday night?⁠—Rogers told me, on Thursday, you were <em>so</em> ill; your letter sent by him was <em>so</em> melancholy!⁠—Yet you must be ill indeed, if you could not write something to such a letter; were it but a line, to say you would write as soon as you could. Sure you have received it. The master of your nearest post-office will pawn his reputation that it went safe: I gave him particular charge of it.</p>
				<p>God send me good news of your health, of your ability to write; and then I will chide you⁠—indeed I will⁠—as I never yet did chide you.</p>
				<p>I suppose your excuse will be, that the subject required consideration⁠—Lord! my dear, so it might; but you have so right a mind, and the matter in question is so obvious, that you could not want half an hour to determine.⁠—Then you intended, probably, to wait Collins’s call for your letter as on tomorrow!⁠—Suppose something were to happen, as it did on Friday, that he should not be able to go to town tomorrow?⁠—How, child, could you serve me so!⁠—I know not how to leave off scolding you!</p>
				<p>Dear, honest Collins, make haste: he will: he will. He sets out, and travels all night: for I have told him, that the dearest friend I have in the world has it in her own choice to be happy, and to make me so; and that the letter he will bring from her will assure it to me.</p>
				<p>I have ordered him to go directly (without stopping at the Saracen’s-head-inn) to you at your lodgings. Matters are now in so good a way, that he safely may.</p>
				<p>Your expected letter is ready written I hope: if it can be not, he will call for it at your hour.</p>
				<p>You can’t be so happy as you deserve to be: but I doubt not that you will be as happy as you <em>can</em>; that is, that you will choose to put yourself instantly into Lady Betty’s protection. If you would not have the wretch for <em>your own</em> sake; have him you must, for <em>mine</em>, for your <em>family’s</em>, for your <em>honour’s</em>, sake!⁠—Dear, honest Collins, make haste! make haste! and relieve the impatient heart of my beloved’s</p>
