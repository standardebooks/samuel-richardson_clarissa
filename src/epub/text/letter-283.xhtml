				<p>I cannot find words to express how much I am mortified at the return of my messenger without a line from you.</p>
				<p>Thursday is so near, that I will send messenger after messenger every four hours, till I have a favourable answer; the one to meet the other, till its eve arrives, to know if I may venture to appear in your presence with the hope of having my wishes answered on that day.</p>
				<p>Your love, Madam, I neither expect, nor ask for; nor will, till my future behaviour gives you cause to think I deserve it.

If your resentment be still too high to write more, let it only be in your own dear hand, these words, <em><abbr>St.</abbr> Martin’s church, Thursday</em>⁠—or these, <em><abbr>St.</abbr> Giles’s church, Thursday</em>; nor will I insist upon any inscription or subscription, or so much as the initials of your name. This shall be all the favour I will expect, till the dear hand itself is given to mine, in presence of that Being whom I invoke as a witness of the inviolable faith and honour of</p>
