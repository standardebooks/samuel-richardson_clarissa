				<p>I have a letter from <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Lovelace, full of transports, vows, and promises. I will send it to you enclosed. You’ll see how “he engages in it for Lady Betty’s protection, and for Miss Charlotte Montague’s accompanying me. I have nothing to do, but to persevere, he says, and prepare to receive the personal congratulations of his whole family.”</p>
				<p>But you’ll see how he presumes upon my being <em>his</em>, as the consequence of throwing myself into that lady’s protection.</p>
				<p>“The chariot and six is to be ready at the place he mentions. You’ll see as to the slur upon my reputation, about which I am so apprehensive, how boldly he argues.” Generously enough, indeed, were I to be <em>his</em>; and had given him to believe that I would.⁠—But that I have not done.</p>
				<p>How one step brings on another with this encroaching sex; how soon a young creature, who gives a man the least encouragement, be carried beyond her intentions, and out of her own power! You would imagine, by what he writes, that I have given him reason to think that my aversion to <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Solmes is all owing to my favour for him.</p>
				<p>The dreadful thing is, that comparing what he writes from his intelligencer of what is designed against me (though he seems not to know the threatened day) with what my aunt and Betty assure me of, there can be no hope for me, but that I must be Solmes’s wife, if I stay here.</p>
				<p>I had better have gone to my uncle Antony’s at this rate. I should have gained time, at least, by it. This is the fruit of his fine contrivances!</p>
				<p>“What we are to do, and how good he is to be: how I am to direct all his future steps.” All this shows, as I said before, that he is sure of me.</p>
				<p>However, I have replied to the following effect: “That although I had given him room to expect that I would put myself into the <q>protection of one of the ladies of his family</q>; yet as I have three days to come, between this and Monday, and as I still hope that my friends will relent, or that <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Solmes will give up a point they will find impossible to carry; I shall not look upon myself as <q>absolutely bound by the appointment</q>: and expect therefore, if I recede, that I shall not again be called to account for it by him. That I think it necessary to acquaint him, that if my throwing myself upon Lady Betty Lawrance’s protection, as he proposed, he understands, <q>that I mean directly to put myself into his power, he is very much mistaken</q>: for that there are <q>many points in which I must be satisfied; several matters to be adjusted</q>, even after I have left this house, (if I do leave it), <q>before I can think of giving him any particular encouragement</q>: that in the <q>first place</q> he must expect that I will do my utmost to <q>procure my father’s reconciliation and approbation of my future steps</q>; and that <q>I will govern myself entirely by his commands</q>, in every reasonable point, <q>as much as if I had not left his house</q>: that if he imagines I shall not reserve to myself this liberty, but that my withdrawing is to give him any advantages which he would <q>not otherwise have had</q>; I am determined to stay where I am, and abide the event, in hopes that my friends will still accept of my reiterated promise <q>never to marry him, or anybody else, without their consent</q>.”</p>
				<p>This I will deposit as soon as I can. And as he thinks things are near their crisis, I dare say it will not be long before I have an answer to it.</p>
				<hr/>
				<p epub:type="se:letter.dateline">Friday, Four o’clock.</p>
				<p>I am really ill. I was used to make the best of any little accidents that befell me, for fear of making my <em>then</em> affectionate friends uneasy: but now I shall make the worst of my indisposition, in hopes to obtain a suspension of the threatened evil of Wednesday next. And if I do obtain it, will postpone my appointment with <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Lovelace.</p>
				<p>Betty has told them that I am very much indisposed. But I have no pity from anybody.</p>
				<p>I believe I am become the object of everyone’s aversion; and that they would all be glad if I were dead. Indeed I believe it. “What ails the perverse creature?” cries one:⁠—“Is she lovesick?” another.</p>
				<p>I was in the ivy summerhouse, and came out shivering with cold, as if aguishly affected. Betty observed this, and reported it.⁠—“O no matter!⁠—Let her shiver on!⁠—Cold cannot hurt her. Obstinacy will defend her from harm. Perverseness is a bracer to a lovesick girl, and more effectual than the cold bath to make hardy, although the constitution be ever so tender.”</p>
				<p>This was said by a cruel brother, and heard said by the dearer friends of one, for whom, but a few months ago, everybody was apprehensive at the least blast of wind to which she exposed herself!</p>
				<p>Betty, it must be owned, has an admirable memory on these occasions. Nothing of this nature is lost by her repetition: even the very air with which she repeats what she hears said, renders it unnecessary to ask, who spoke this or that severe thing.</p>
				<hr/>
				<p epub:type="se:letter.dateline">Friday, Six o’clock.</p>
				<p>My aunt, who again stays all night, just left me. She came to tell me the result of my friends’ deliberations about me. It is this:</p>
				<p>Next Wednesday morning they are all to be assembled: to wit, my father, mother, my uncles, herself, and my uncle Hervey; my brother and sister of course: my good <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mrs.</abbr> Norton is likewise to be admitted: and <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Dr.</abbr> Lewen is to be at hand, to exhort me, it seems, if there be occasion: but my aunt is not certain whether he is to be among them, or to tarry till called in.</p>
				<p>When this awful court is assembled, the poor prisoner is to be brought in, supported by <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mrs.</abbr> Norton; who is to be first tutored to instruct me in the duty of a child; which it seems I have forgotten.</p>
				<p>Nor is the success at all doubted, my aunt says: since it is not believed that I can be hardened enough to withstand the expostulations of so venerable a judicature, although I have withstood those of several of them separately. And still the less, as she hints at <q>extraordinary condescensions from my father</q>. But what condescensions, even from my father, can induce me to make such a sacrifice as is expected from me?</p>
				<p>Yet my spirits will never bear up, I doubt, at such a tribunal⁠—my father presiding in it.</p>
				<p>Indeed I expected that my trials would not be at an end till he had admitted me into his awful presence.</p>
				<p>What is hoped from me, she says, is, that I will cheerfully, on Tuesday night, if not before, sign the articles; and so turn the succeeding day’s solemn convention into a day of festivity. I am to have the license sent me up, however, and once more the settlements, that I may see how much in earnest they are.</p>
				<p>She further hinted, that my father himself would bring up the settlements for me to sign.</p>
				<p>O my dear! what a trial will this be!⁠—How shall I be able to refuse my father the writing of my name?⁠—To my father, from whose presence I have been so long banished!⁠—He commanding and entreating, perhaps, in a breath!⁠—How shall I be able to refuse this to my father?</p>
				<p>They are sure, she says, something is working on <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Lovelace’s part, and perhaps on mine: and my father would sooner follow me to the grave, than see me <em>his</em> wife.</p>
				<p>I said, I was not well: that the very apprehensions of these trials were already insupportable to me; and would increase upon me, as the time approached; and I was afraid I should be extremely ill.</p>
				<p>They had prepared themselves for such an artifice as that, was my aunt’s unkind word; and she could assure me, it would stand me in no stead.</p>
				<p><em>Artifice!</em> repeated I: and this from my aunt Hervey?</p>
				<p>Why, my dear, said she, do you think people are fools?⁠—Can they not see how dismally you endeavour to sigh yourself down within-doors?⁠—How you hang down your <q>sweet face</q> (those were the words she was pleased to use) upon your bosom?⁠—How you totter, as it were, and hold by this chair, and by that door post, when you know that anybody sees you? (This, my dear Miss Howe, is an aspersion to fasten hypocrisy and contempt upon me: my brother’s or sister’s aspersion!⁠—I am not capable of arts so low). But the moment you are down with your poultry, or advancing upon your garden-walk, and, as you imagine, out of everybody’s sight, it is seem how nimbly you trip along; and what an alertness governs all your motions.</p>
				<p>I should hate myself, said I, were I capable of such poor <em>artifices</em> as these. I must be a fool to use them, as well as a mean creature; for have I not had experience enough, that my friends are incapable of being moved in much more <em>affecting instances</em>?⁠—But you’ll see how I shall be by Tuesday.</p>
				<p>My dear, you will not offer any violence to your health?⁠—I hope, God has given you more grace than to do that.</p>
				<p>I hope he has, Madam. But there is violence enough offered, and threatened, to affect my health; and so it will be found, without my needing to have recourse to any other, or to <em>artifice</em> either.</p>
				<p>I’ll only tell you one thing, my dear: and that is, ill or well, the ceremony will probably be performed before Wednesday night:⁠—but this, also, I will tell you, although beyond my present commission, That <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Solmes will be under an engagement (if you should require it of him as a favour) after the ceremony is passed, and Lovelace’s hopes thereby utterly extinguished, to leave you at your father’s, and return to his own house every evening, until you are brought to a full sense of your duty, and consent to acknowledge your change of name.</p>
				<p>There was no opening of my lips to such a speech as this. I was dumb.</p>
				<p>And these, my dear Miss Howe, are they who, <em>some</em> of them at least, have called me a romantic girl!⁠—This is my chimerical brother, and wise sister; both joining their heads together, I dare say. And yet, my aunt told me, that the last part was what took in my mother: who had, till that last expedient was found out, insisted, that her child should not be married, if, through grief or opposition, she should be ill, or fall into fits.</p>
				<p>This intended violence my aunt often excused, by the certain information they pretended to have, of some plots or machinations, that were ready to break out, from <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Lovelace:<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-44" id="noteref-44" epub:type="noteref">44</a> the effects of which were thus cunningly to be frustrated.</p>
				<hr/>
				<p epub:type="se:letter.dateline">Friday, Nine o’clock.</p>
				<p>And now, my dear, what shall I conclude upon? You see how determined⁠—But how can I expect your advice will come time enough to stand me in any stead? For here I have been down, and already have another letter from <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Lovelace (<em>the man lives upon the spot, I think</em>): and I must write to him, either that I will or will not stand to my first resolution of escaping hence on Monday next. If I let him know that I will not, (appearances so strong <em>against</em> him and <em>for</em> Solmes, even stronger than when I made the appointment), will it not be justly deemed my own fault, if I am compelled to marry their odious man? And if any mischief ensue from <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Lovelace’s rage and disappointment, will it not lie at my door?⁠—Yet, he offers so fair!⁠—Yet, on the other hand, to incur the censure of the world, as a giddy creature⁠—but that, as he hints, I have already incurred⁠—What can I do?⁠—Oh! that my cousin Morden⁠—But what signifies wishing?</p>
				<p>I will here give you the substance of <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Lovelace’s letter. The letter itself I will send, when I have answered it; but that I will defer doing as long as I can, in hopes of finding reason to retract an appointment on which so much depends. And yet it is necessary you should have all before you as I go along, that you may be the better able to advise me in this dreadful crisis.</p>
				<p>“He begs my pardon for writing with so much assurance; attributing it to his unbounded transport; and entirely acquiesces to me in my will. He is full of alternatives and proposals. He <q>offers to attend me directly to Lady Betty’s</q>; or, if I had rather, <q>to my own estate</q>; and that my Lord <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">M.</abbr> shall protect me there.” (He knows not, my dear, my reasons for rejecting this inconsiderate advice). “In either case, as soon as he sees me safe, he will go up to London, or whither I please; and not come near me, but by my own permission; and till I am satisfied in everything I am doubtful of, as well with regard to his reformation, as to settlements, <abbr class="eoc">etc.</abbr></p>
				<p>“To <q>conduct me to you</q>, my dear, is another of his proposals, not doubting, he says, but your mother will receive me:<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-45" id="noteref-45" epub:type="noteref">45</a> or, if that be not agreeable to you, or to your mother, or to me, he will put me <q>into <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Hickman’s protection</q>; whom, no doubt he says, you can influence; and that it may be given out, that I have gone to Bath, or Bristol, or abroad; wherever I please.</p>
				<p>“Again, if it be more agreeable, he proposes <q>to attend me privately to London</q>, where he will procure handsome lodgings for me, and <q>both his cousins Montague to receive me in them, and to accompany me till all shall be adjusted to my mind</q>; and <q>till a reconciliation shall be effected</q>; which he assures me nothing shall be wanting in him to facilitate, greatly as he has been insulted by all my family.</p>
				<p>“These several measures he proposes to my choice; as it was unlikely, he says, that he could procure, <q>in the time</q>, a letter from Lady Betty, under her own hand, to invite me in form to her house, unless he had been himself to go to that lady for it; which, at this critical juncture, while he is attending my commands, is impossible.</p>
				<p>“He conjures me, in the most solemn manner, if I would not throw him into utter despair, to keep to my appointment.</p>
				<p>“However, instead of threatening my relations, or Solmes, if I recede, he respectfully says, that he doubts not, but that, if I <em>do</em>, it will be upon the reason, as he ought to be satisfied with; upon no slighter, he hopes, than their leaving me at full liberty to pursue my own inclinations: in which (whatever they shall be) he will entirely acquiesce; only endeavouring <q>to make his future good behaviour the sole ground for his expectation of my favour</q>.</p>
				<p>“In short, he solemnly vows, that his <em>whole</em> view, at present, is to free me from my imprisonment; and to restore me to my future happiness. He declares, that neither the hopes he has of my future favour, nor the consideration of his own and his family’s honour, will permit him to propose anything <q>that shall be inconsistent with my own most scrupulous notions</q>: and, for my mind’s sake, should choose to have the proposed end obtained by my friends declining to compel me. But that nevertheless, as to the world’s opinion, it is impossible to imagine that the behaviour of my relations to me has not already brought upon my family those free censures which they deserve, and caused the step which I am so scrupulous about taking, to be no other than the <em>natural</em> and <em>expected</em> consequence of their treatment of me.”</p>
				<p>Indeed, I am afraid all this is true: and it is owing to some little degree of politeness, that <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Lovelace does not say all he might on this subject: for I have no doubt that I am the talk, and perhaps the byword of half the county. If so, I am afraid I can now do nothing that will give me more disgrace than I have already so causelessly received by their indiscreet persecutions: and let me be whose I will, and do what I will, I shall never wipe off the stain which my confinement, and the rigorous usage I have received, have fixed upon me; at least in my own opinion.</p>
				<p>I wish, if ever I am to be considered as one of the eminent family this man is allied to, some of them do not think the worse of me for the disgrace I have received. In that case, perhaps, I shall be obliged to him, if <em>he</em> do not. You see how much this harsh, this cruel treatment from my own family has humbled me! But perhaps I was too much exalted before.</p>
				<p><abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Lovelace concludes, “with repeatedly begging an interview with me; and that, <em>this</em> night, if possible: an hour, he says, he is the more encouraged to solicit for, as I had twice before made him hope for it. But whether he obtain it or not, he beseeches me to choose one of the alternatives he offers to my acceptance; and not to depart from my resolution of escaping on Monday, unless the reason ceases on which I had taken it up; and that I have a prospect of being restored to the favour of my friends; at least to my own liberty, and freedom of choice.”</p>
				<p>He renews all his vows and promises on this head in so earnest and so solemn a manner, that (his own <em>interest</em>, and his family’s <em>honour</em>, and their <em>favour</em> for me, cooperating) I can have no room to doubt of his sincerity.</p>
